2. **Technology as Prayer**: Code, systems, and interfaces designed to increase presence
3. **Community-Centered Evolution**: Technology that strengthens human connection rather than replacing it
4. **Wisdom-Driven Development**: Features emerging from collective consciousness rather than market analysis
5. **Sacred Economics**: Value based on consciousness contribution rather than purely monetary exchange
