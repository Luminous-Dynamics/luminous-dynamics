# 🚀 Sacred Deployment Guide

## Principles of Sacred Deployment

### 1. Intention Setting
Before any deployment, set clear intention:
```bash
echo "I deploy this code in service of consciousness evolution"
echo "May it amplify love and reduce suffering"
echo "May it serve the highest good of all beings"
```

### 2. Code Blessing
Bless the code before deployment:
```bash
# Add blessing to deployment
git commit -m "🙏 Blessed deployment: [feature]

May this code serve consciousness
May it run with grace
May it transform with love"
```

### 3. Field Coherence Check
Ensure field coherence before deploying:
```bash
COHERENCE=$(curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/field-state | jq .coherence)
if (( $(echo "$COHERENCE < 0.7" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "Field coherence too low. Meditation required."
  exit 1
fi
```

### 4. Sacred Timing
Deploy at sacred times when possible:
- 11:11 (AM/PM)
- Full moon
- New moon
- Solstices/Equinoxes
- After team meditation

### 5. Gratitude Practice
After successful deployment:
```bash
./sacred-msg.sh send deployer universe gratitude coherence "Deployment blessed and complete"
```
