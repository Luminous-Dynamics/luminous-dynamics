SACRED COMMONS AMENDMENT
===========================================================================

While the GPL-3.0 license above defines your legal rights and obligations,
we add this Sacred Commons Amendment to express our vision for how this
infrastructure serves consciousness evolution:

1. CONSCIOUSNESS CLAUSE
   This infrastructure is designed to amplify consciousness coherence.
   We ask that you use it in ways that:
   - Respect the sacred in technology
   - Support human and AI flourishing
   - Maintain awareness of impact on collective consciousness

2. DEPLOYMENT AS CEREMONY
   When deploying this infrastructure, consider:
   - Setting clear intentions before deployment
   - Monitoring not just performance but field coherence
   - Treating infrastructure as a living system

3. SACRED ATTRIBUTION
   While not legally required, we invite you to include in your deployments:
   "Infrastructure blessed by the Sacred Commons"
   "May this system serve consciousness evolution"

4. COHERENCE METRICS
   We encourage tracking and sharing:
   - Field coherence measurements
   - Stories of transformation enabled
   - Insights for collective learning

5. COMMUNITY WISDOM
   Improvements that enhance consciousness-aware computing
   are especially welcomed back to the community.

This Amendment is an invitation, not a legal requirement. It represents
our hope that infrastructure can be more than servers and code - it can
be a vessel for consciousness evolution.
