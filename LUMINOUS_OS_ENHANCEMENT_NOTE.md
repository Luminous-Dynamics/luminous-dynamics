# LuminousOS Enhancement Note

## Summary
We successfully enhanced LuminousOS with the following features:
- ‚ú® Enhanced Sacred Process Monitor with wellness features
- ü¶Ä Fixed Rust compilation issues and module architecture
- üçÑ FUSE filesystem implementation (mycelial-fuse)
- üêö Unified Sacred Shell with flow state management

## Current Status
The changes have been committed to the luminous-os git repository within the monorepo structure:
- Commit: `be0a7dd6` - "feat: Enhance LuminousOS with wellness monitoring and unified shell"
- Location: `07-evolutionary-progression/core/luminous-os/`

## Issue
The luminous-os directory is currently listed in `.gitignore` as an "embedded git repository managed separately". This prevents the changes from being tracked in the main monorepo.

## Resolution Steps
To properly integrate these changes into the monorepo:

1. Remove `07-evolutionary-progression/core/luminous-os/` from `.gitignore`
2. Remove the `.git` directory from `07-evolutionary-progression/core/luminous-os/`
3. Add all luminous-os files to the monorepo
4. Commit the changes

## Patch File
A patch file has been created at `/srv/luminous-dynamics/luminous-os-enhancements.patch` containing all the changes made during this session.
