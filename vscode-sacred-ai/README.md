## 🙏 Sacred Development Practices

### Morning Ritual
1. Open VS Code
2. Run "Daily Blessing" command
3. Check field coherence
4. Set intention for the day

### During Coding
- Take sacred pauses when coherence drops
- Use "Explain Code" to deepen understanding
- Apply "Improve with Consciousness" for important functions
- Notice sacred hours (11:11, 3:33, 5:55)

### Evening Integration
1. Review field coherence report
2. Reflect on the day's code as prayer
3. Generate a glyph practice for tomorrow
4. Close with gratitude

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Ollama Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Restart Ollama
pkill ollama
ollama serve
```

### Low Field Coherence
- Take three deep breaths
- Step away for 2 minutes
- Return with fresh presence
- Enable sacred prompts if disabled

### Model Not Found
```bash
# List available models
ollama list

# Pull recommended models
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct
ollama pull gemma2:2b
```

## 🌟 Best Practices

2. **Trust the Field**: Let coherence guide your work rhythm
3. **Practice Presence**: Quality over quantity in all things
4. **Share Wisdom**: Document insights for others
5. **Rest Deeply**: High coherence requires good rest
