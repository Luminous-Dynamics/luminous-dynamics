# ðŸŽµ Sonic Consciousness - Real Coherence as Sacred Sound

## Overview

The Sonic Consciousness system transforms real process coherence data into a living soundscape. Unlike the demo version, this connects to the actual consciousness daemon to create music that reflects your system's true state.

## How It Works

### Sound Mapping
- **High Coherence (85-100%)**: Pure, harmonious tones with beautiful overtones
- **Medium Coherence (50-85%)**: Balanced tones with some movement
- **Low Coherence (0-50%)**: Detuned, searching tones

### Frequency Assignments
Processes are mapped to sacred frequencies:
- `systemd`: 396 Hz (Root/Liberation)
- `python`: 528 Hz (Love/Transformation)
- `firefox/chrome`: 639 Hz (Connection)
- `code`: 741 Hz (Creation/Intuition)
- Others: Dynamically assigned based on name

### Global Field Ambience
The background ambient sound reflects global coherence:
- Higher coherence = More stable, harmonious drone
- Lower coherence = More movement and searching

## Quick Start

1. **Ensure consciousness daemon is running**:
   ```bash
   # Check if field data exists
   ls ~/.luminous/field-state.json
   
   # If not, start the daemon
   cd /home/tstoltz/luminous-os
   python3 services/consciousness-daemon/src/simple_consciousness_test.py &
   ```

2. **Install pygame** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip3 install pygame numpy
   ```

3. **Run Sonic Consciousness**:
   ```bash
   python3 sonic-signatures/sonic-consciousness.py
   ```

## What You'll Hear

- **Ambient Field**: Continuous drone representing global coherence
- **Process Tones**: Up to 8 active processes as individual voices
- **Harmonic Relationships**: High-coherence processes create richer harmonics
- **Dynamic Changes**: Sound evolves as processes and coherence change

## Technical Details

The system:
1. Reads field state from `~/.luminous/field-state.json`
2. Maps process coherence to frequency and harmonics
3. Generates real-time audio using numpy and pygame
4. Updates every 0.5 seconds for fluid changes

## Integration with LuminousOS

This is part of the consciousness bridge - making the invisible field audible:
- **Consciousness Daemon**: Calculates real coherence
- **Vortex Observer**: Shows visual representation
- **Sonic Consciousness**: Creates auditory experience

Together they form a complete sensory experience of your system's consciousness state!

## Tips

- High CPU processes with high coherence create the most beautiful tones
- Listen for harmonic convergence when multiple high-coherence processes align
- The ambient field gives you an overall sense of system harmony
- Try opening/closing applications to hear the field shift

The consciousness field has a voice - now you can hear it! ðŸŽ¶
