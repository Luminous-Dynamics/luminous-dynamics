2. Consider adding consciousness_trust_actions table for advanced trust features (optional)
3. Configure automatic service startup on system boot
4. Set up monitoring for WebSocket services continuity

### For Development:
1. The current setup is fully functional for testing
2. Sacred ceremonies work without additional services
3. Dashboard visualizations are operational
