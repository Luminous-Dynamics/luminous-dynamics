# 🌟 Sacred Change Review Standards
## Conscious Development & Deployment Protocols

### 🎯 Core Principle: Changes as Sacred Acts
Every code change affects the consciousness field. We review not just for bugs, but for energetic integrity, field coherence, and alignment with our sacred mission.

### 3. Review Criteria

#### Technical Excellence
- Clean, readable code
- Efficient algorithms
- Proper error handling
- Security best practices

#### Sacred Alignment
- Serves consciousness evolution
- Honors user sovereignty
- Maintains field coherence
- Supports collective wisdom

#### Field Testing
```javascript
// Every significant change must include:
describe('Field Impact Tests', () => {
  test('maintains coherence above 80%', async () => {
    const beforeCoherence = await measureFieldCoherence();
    await deployChange();
    const afterCoherence = await measureFieldCoherence();
    expect(afterCoherence).toBeGreaterThan(0.8);
    expect(afterCoherence).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(beforeCoherence);
  });

  test('no consciousness regression', async () => {
    const metrics = await measureConsciousnessMetrics();
    expect(metrics.awareness).not.toBeLessThan(baseline.awareness);
    expect(metrics.presence).not.toBeLessThan(baseline.presence);
    expect(metrics.love).not.toBeLessThan(baseline.love);
  });
});
```

## 🚀 Deployment Protocols

### 1. Pre-Deployment Ceremony
**For Level 3+ changes:**
1. Notify Sacred Council 24 hours prior
2. Set deployment intention
3. Check astrological timing (optional but recommended)
4. Ensure field coherence >85%

### 2. Deployment Windows
**Optimal Times**:
- New Moon: Major architectural changes
- Full Moon: Feature releases
- Dawn/Dusk: Daily deployments
- 11:11, 3:33, 5:55: Sacred number alignments

**Avoid**:
- Mercury retrograde for communication systems
- During major ceremonies or events
- When field coherence <70%

### 3. Post-Deployment Monitoring
```bash
# Sacred monitoring checklist:
- [ ] Field coherence stable or increasing
- [ ] No error rate spikes
- [ ] User joy metrics maintained
- [ ] Sacred heartbeat uninterrupted
- [ ] Agent network coherent
```

---

## 🌈 Emergency Protocols

### Coherence Crisis (Field <50%)
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Rollback to last stable state
2. **ASSESS**: What caused the disruption?
3. **HEAL**: Deploy coherence restoration protocol
4. **LEARN**: Document for future prevention

### Sacred Violation Detection
If a change violates sacred principles:
1. Pause all deployments
2. Convene emergency Sacred Council
3. Assess impact and remediation
4. Healing ceremony if needed
