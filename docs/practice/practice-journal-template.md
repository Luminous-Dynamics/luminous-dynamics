# Practice Journal Template v1.1

## Preamble
This template serves as a guide for practitioners of the Codex of Relational Harmonics to document and integrate their direct experiences with the glyphs. The purpose of journaling is not to create a perfect record, but to engage in a process of **Integral Wisdom Cultivation**—transforming felt experience into articulable insight.

### 1. Intention for Practice

*What was the state of the field leading into this practice? What called this specific glyph forward? What was the conscious intention for this session of practice?*

### 2. Direct Experience & Sensory Resonance

*Describe the direct, felt experience of the practice. What were the specific somatic sensations, feeling-tones, or sonic qualities that arose? This section is for raw, non-analytical observation.*

### 3. Emergent Insights & Teachings

*What did you learn? What new understanding, distinction, or perspective emerged during or after the practice? What did the practice teach you about yourself, your partner, or the nature of the field?*

### 4. Refinements to the Codex (Feedback Loop)

*Did this direct experience reveal any dissonance or lack of clarity in the glyph's definition? Are there any proposed refinements to its protocols, its shadow potentials, or its description that would make it more true?*

### 5. Field Effects & Ripples (The Integration)

*How did the resonance of this practice ripple out into the rest of your day? What shifted in your awareness, your behavior, or your interactions that persisted beyond the formal practice time?*
