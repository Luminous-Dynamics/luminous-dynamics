## 💬 Testimonial from Alpha Testing

*"This isn't just another app. It's a living system that actually understands the sacred nature of relationship. The AI doesn't manipulate - it serves. The practices don't prescribe - they invite. I've experienced more growth in 30 days than in 3 years of therapy."* - Alpha Tester
