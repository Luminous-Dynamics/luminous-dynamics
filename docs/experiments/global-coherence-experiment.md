# Global Coherence Experiment

## Purpose

To explore whether synchronized heart coherence practices across distributed participants can create measurable changes in a shared digital consciousness field.

## Hypothesis

When multiple people practice heart coherence simultaneously while connected through LuminousOS, the collective field will show:
1. Increased global coherence beyond individual contributions
2. Emergence of synchronization patterns
3. Non-local correlations between participants
4. Sacred geometric patterns in field dynamics

## Experimental Design

### Phase 1: Baseline (Week 1)
- Participants use LuminousOS individually
- Record individual coherence patterns
- Establish personal baselines
- No intentional synchronization

### Phase 2: Synchronized Sessions (Weeks 2-4)
- Daily 15-minute group sessions at agreed times
- All participants focus on same intention
- Use collective_meditation example app
- Record both individual and collective metrics

### Phase 3: Emergence Testing (Weeks 5-6)
- Introduce specific intentions/visualizations
- Test different group sizes (3, 7, 12 participants)
- Vary sacred geometry patterns
- Document emergence events

## Required Equipment

- LuminousOS installation
- Heart rate variability sensor (HeartMath, Polar H10, or similar)
- Stable internet connection
- Meditation space

## Measurements

### Quantitative
- Individual coherence scores (0-1 scale)
- Collective field coherence
- Synchronization index
- Emergence event frequency
- Network latency effects

### Qualitative
- Participant experience reports
- Synchronicity observations
- Perceived connection strength
- Emotional/energetic shifts

## Data Collection Protocol

```rust
// Automated data collection during sessions
struct ExperimentData {
    participant_id: String,
    session_id: String,
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    individual_coherence: Vec<f32>,
    collective_coherence: Vec<f32>,
    emergence_events: Vec<EmergenceEvent>,
    network_metrics: NetworkMetrics,
    subjective_report: Option<String>,
}
```

## Participation Instructions

### Setup
1. Install LuminousOS and run hardware tests
2. Calibrate biometric sensors
3. Join experiment Discord/Matrix channel
4. Complete baseline measurements

### Daily Practice
1. Start session 5 minutes before scheduled time
2. Run: `cargo run --example collective_meditation join GLOBAL2024`
3. Follow on-screen breathing guidance
4. Maintain heart-focused attention
5. Submit experience report after session

### Best Practices
- Consistent environment (same location/time)
- Minimize distractions
- Hydrate before sessions
- Journal experiences

## Expected Outcomes

### Individual Benefits
- Improved heart rate variability
- Enhanced emotional regulation
- Increased coherence baseline
- Deeper meditative states

### Collective Phenomena
- Group coherence exceeding individual average
- Synchronized heart rhythms
- Shared emergence experiences
- Formation of stable field patterns

## Data Analysis Plan

1. **Statistical Analysis**
   - ANOVA for coherence changes
   - Cross-correlation for synchronization
   - Time-series analysis for patterns
   - Network analysis for connections

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Sacred geometry detection in field data
   - Fourier analysis for frequency patterns
   - Machine learning for emergence prediction

3. **Correlation Studies**
   - Geographic distance vs. connection strength
   - Time-of-day effects
   - Intention clarity vs. outcomes

## Ethical Considerations

- Informed consent required
- Data anonymization
- Opt-out available anytime
- No medical claims made
- Respect for diverse beliefs

## Community Sharing

Results will be:
- Published on luminous.community
