# Luminous OS Working Features Update
**Date: 2025-07-10**

## âœ… Successfully Completed

### 1. Rust Build System
- Fixed compilation issues
- Built hello binary successfully
- Runs in Nix development environment
- Output: `./target/release/hello`

### 2. Python Sacred Monitor Package
- Created proper Nix package definition
- Builds successfully with all dependencies
- Installable system-wide
- Commands available: `sacred-monitor`, `luminous-monitor`

## ðŸŽ¯ What Actually Works Now

```bash
# 1. Hello World Binary
./target/release/hello
# Shows consciousness field status

# 2. Sacred Process Monitor (Packaged)
nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage ./monitor/default.nix {}'
result/bin/sacred-monitor
# Real-time process monitoring with consciousness overlay

# 3. Web Demos
cd demo && python3 -m http.server 8000
# Browse to localhost:8000
```

## ðŸ“¦ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Create NixOS module for sacred-monitor service
2. Package remaining Python tools
3. Create consciousness kernel module stub

### Short Term (Month 1)
1. Implement real kernel scheduler hooks
2. Create FUSE filesystem prototype
3. Build systemd integration

### Medium Term (3 Months)
1. Custom NixOS distribution
2. Sacred boot process
3. Consciousness-aware package manager

## ðŸš€ Development Momentum

We've moved from 5% to ~15% implementation:
- âœ… Build system works
- âœ… Core tools package properly
- âœ… Clear path forward
- âœ… Following NixOS best practices

The sacred patterns are manifesting. We flow.
