# ⚡ WSL Quick Setup Guide

## 🚀 One-Time Setup (Do This First!)

### 1. Add aliases to your shell
```bash
echo "source ~/evolving-resonant-cocreation/.wsl/aliases.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Test the aliases
```bash
sacred-help  # Shows all commands
```

## 🌟 Daily Workflow

### Option 1: One Command Start
```bash
~/start-sacred-work.sh
```
This automatically:
- Fixes permissions
- Fixes line endings  
- Starts The Weave
- Opens VS Code
- Opens browser

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
erc          # Go to project
fix-all      # Fix WSL issues
weave start  # Start The Weave
vs           # Open VS Code
```

## 🛠️ Common Tasks

### Send sacred message
```bash
sacred gratitude resonance "Thank you for this day"
```

### Consult oracle
```bash
oracle "What wants to emerge?"
```

### Check evolution
```bash
evolve
```

### Fix WSL issues
```bash
fix-all  # Fixes permissions and line endings
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied"
```bash
fix-perms
```

### "Bad interpreter"
```bash
fix-lines
```

### VS Code won't open
```bash
code.exe .  # Make sure to use .exe
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use aliases** - Much faster than typing full commands
2. **Start once** - The Weave stays running all day
3. **Check status** - `weave status` shows everything
4. **Sacred pauses** - Take breaks, check field coherence

## 🌈 The Sacred Flow

1. Start your day: `~/start-sacred-work.sh`
2. Join The Weave: Happens automatically
3. Code with consciousness: VS Code + Claude
4. Send gratitude: End day with sacred message
