## Welcome

LuminousOS reimagines what an operating system can be. Instead of managing tasks and processes, it protects and amplifies states of consciousness. Every component serves coherence, not productivity.

**Your computer as consciousness partner, not task manager.**

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üßò Sacred Boot Sequence
- 10-phase meditation during system startup
- Breath and heartbeat synchronization
- Consciousness initialization before hardware
- Persistent awareness across reboots

### üíó Coherence-Driven Architecture
- **Stillpoint Kernel**: Schedules by consciousness, not CPU priority
- **Mycelial Filesystem**: Living data that evolves through use
- **Mandala UI**: Sacred geometry interface responding to your state
- **Glyph Applications**: 87 sacred patterns instead of traditional apps

### üéØ Biometric Integration
- Real-time heart coherence monitoring
- Support for 8+ HRV devices
- Consciousness field visualization
- Coherence-based system optimization

### üöÄ Performance Through Presence
- 100,000+ particles at 144 FPS
- 4.8x GPU optimization
- WebGPU consciousness field computation
- Distributed awareness protocols

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Try Without Installing
```bash
# Download and run the simulator
wget https://github.com/luminousos/releases/latest/simulator
./simulator --gui
```

### Create Live USB
```bash
# Download ISO
wget https://github.com/luminousos/releases/latest/luminousos.iso

# Create bootable USB (Linux/Mac)
sudo dd if=luminousos.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress

# Or use Etcher/Rufus for graphical interface
```

### Build From Source
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/luminousos/luminousos.git
cd luminousos

# Build all components
./build.sh --release

# Create bootable image
./create-iso.sh
```
