## How to Add Topics:
1. Visit each repository on GitHub
2. Click the gear ⚙️ icon next to "About" 
3. In the "Topics" field, add the topics (without quotes)
4. Click "Save changes"

## Why These Topics:
- **erc** appears in multiple repos to connect them
- **consciousness** and **coherence** reflect core philosophy
- **love-guided** emphasizes the Meta-Principle
- Technical terms (kubernetes, docker) for discoverability
- Avoids overly mystical language while honoring the sacred

Each repository gets exactly 10 topics for consistency.
