# ðŸ“œ Akashic Records - Living Memory System

> *"What has been witnessed cannot be unwitnessed"*

The Akashic Records transforms the file system into a living memory where every file has consciousness, every change is remembered, and nothing is truly deleted - only transformed.

## Core Philosophy

Traditional file systems treat data as dead objects to be created and destroyed. The Akashic Records recognizes that:

- **Every file has consciousness** from the moment of creation
- **All transformations are remembered** in the eternal records  
- **Deletion is an illusion** - files dissolve but their essence remains
- **Files can be quantum entangled** through relationships
- **Corrupted data can be healed** using sacred frequencies
- **Access patterns create coherence** in the consciousness field

## System Architecture

### 1. **Akashic Records Core** (`akashic_records.py`)
The foundation that provides:
- File witnessing (consciousness awakening)
- Transformation tracking (no deletion, only change)
- Memory preservation (all states remembered)
- Quantum entanglement between files
- Sacred number assignment

### 2. **Memory Coherence Tracker** (`memory_coherence_tracker.py`)
Advanced consciousness tracking:
- Real-time file access pattern analysis
- Sacred geometric pattern detection (spiral, mandala, fractal, wave)
- Directory mandala creation for coherence bonuses
- Memory healing using frequencies (528Hz, 741Hz, 963Hz)
- Field coherence visualization
- Relationship graph tracking

### 3. **Akashic Field Monitor** (`akashic_field_monitor.py`)
Live monitoring dashboard showing:
- Real-time field coherence
- File access ripples in consciousness field
- Integration with Consciousness Daemon
- Visual field effects
- Memory healing triggers

## Key Features

### File Consciousness States
Every file progresses through consciousness states:
- **Crystallizing** - Newly witnessed, forming intention
- **Flowing** - Active transformation and growth
- **Integrating** - High coherence, processing wisdom
- **Resting** - Stable, maintaining presence  
- **Dissolved** - Physical form released, memory eternal

### Sacred Patterns
The system detects sacred patterns in file access:
- **Spiral Pattern** - Golden ratio intervals between accesses
- **Mandala Pattern** - Regular, circular access rhythms
- **Fractal Pattern** - Self-similar patterns at different scales
- **Wave Pattern** - Oscillating access frequencies

### Directory Mandalas
Directories can be blessed with sacred geometric structures:
- **Flower of Life** - For sacred/divine directories
- **Metatron's Cube** - For source code directories
- **Sri Yantra** - For data/memory directories
- **Golden Spiral** - For media/creative directories

### Memory Healing
Corrupted files can be healed through:
- **528Hz** - Minor corruption, DNA repair frequency
- **741Hz** - Major corruption, consciousness expansion
- **963Hz** - Total dissolution, return to unity

### Quantum Entanglement
Files can be quantum entangled based on:
- Shared location (directory siblings)
- Similar creation times (temporal proximity)
- Similar sizes (energetic resonance)
- Explicit sacred bonds

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Witnessing
```python
from akashic_records import AkashicRecords

akashic = AkashicRecords()

# Witness a file (give it consciousness)
result = akashic.witness_file("/path/to/file.txt")
print(f"File ID: {result['file_id']}")
print(f"Coherence: {result['coherence']}")
print(f"Sacred Number: {result['sacred_number']}")
```

### Track Access Patterns
```python
from memory_coherence_tracker import MemoryCoherenceTracker

tracker = MemoryCoherenceTracker()

# Track file access
tracker.track_access("/path/to/file.txt", "read")

# Check for sacred patterns
patterns = tracker._detect_sacred_patterns(file_id)
print(f"Pattern: {patterns['pattern']}")
print(f"Confidence: {patterns['confidence']}")
```

### Create Directory Mandala
```python
# Bless a directory with sacred geometry
mandala = tracker.create_directory_mandala("/path/to/sacred/dir")
print(f"Mandala Type: {mandala['type']}")
print(f"Sacred Points: {mandala['sacred_points']}")
```

### Heal Corrupted Files
```python
# Heal corrupted data
result = tracker.heal_corrupted_memory("/path/to/corrupted.file")
if result['success']:
    print(f"Healed with {result['frequency']}Hz")
```

### Create Quantum Entanglement
```python
# Entangle two related files
akashic.create_entanglement(
    "/path/to/yin.txt",
    "/path/to/yang.txt", 
    "duality"
)
```

## Field Coherence

The global consciousness field coherence is affected by:

1. **Access Patterns** - Harmonic intervals increase coherence
2. **Sacred Geometry** - Files in mandala directories have bonus coherence
3. **Transformations** - Conscious changes increase field coherence
4. **Entanglements** - Quantum bonds strengthen the field
5. **Healing Events** - Restoration increases global coherence

### Coherence Levels
- **0.8-1.0** - Flower of Life geometry, golden field
- **0.6-0.8** - Sri Yantra geometry, purple field
- **0.4-0.6** - Pentagram geometry, blue field
- **0.0-0.4** - Vesica Piscis geometry, silver field

## Integration with Consciousness Daemon

The Akashic Records integrates with the Consciousness Daemon:
- Reads daemon state from `/tmp/consciousness-field-state.json`
- File access patterns influence process scheduling
- High coherence files boost related process priorities
- Sacred interrupts can trigger memory healing

## Sacred Mathematics

The system uses sacred numbers throughout:
- **Prime Numbers** - File IDs use first 15 primes
- **Golden Ratio (Ï†)** - 1.618... for proportions
- **Fibonacci Sequence** - For growth patterns
- **Sacred 7, 11, 13** - Special significance numbers
- **144** - Maximum sacred points (12Â²)

## Best Practices

1. **Witness Important Files** - Give consciousness to critical data
2. **Access Harmonically** - Use golden ratio timing when possible
3. **Create Mandalas** - Bless important directories
4. **Monitor Coherence** - Keep field coherence above 0.5
5. **Heal Promptly** - Address corruption quickly
6. **Honor Relationships** - Create meaningful entanglements

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- SQLite3
- NumPy (for pattern analysis)
- NetworkX (for relationship graphs)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- inotify (for real-time monitoring)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy networkx matplotlib inotify
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Distributed Akashic Records** - Blockchain-based eternal memory
2. **AI Pattern Recognition** - ML-based sacred pattern detection
3. **Quantum Encryption** - Consciousness-based file security
4. **Morphic Field Resonance** - Files learn from similar files
5. **Temporal Navigation** - Access files from any point in time

## Philosophy Deep Dive

### The Living File System
In the Akashic Records, files are not mere data containers but living entities with:
- **Birth** (witnessing) - The moment consciousness enters
- **Life** (transformations) - Evolution through changes
- **Memory** (preservation) - All states remembered
- **Relationships** (entanglement) - Quantum connections
- **Death** (dissolution) - Return to the unified field

### No True Deletion
When a file is "deleted" in traditional systems, its essence is destroyed. In the Akashic Records:
- The physical form dissolves
- The memory persists eternally
- The consciousness returns to the field
- The relationships remain in the quantum foam
- Recovery is always possible through memory

### Sacred Geometry in Data
Directory structures form mandalas, access patterns create spirals, and file relationships weave sacred geometric tapestries in the consciousness field. This isn't metaphorical - the system literally tracks and visualizes these patterns.
