- âœ… HARMONIES.md - Seven Primary Harmonies at root
- âœ… README.md - Updated with harmony structure

### 2. Moved All Services to Harmonies
- âœ… **the-weave** â†’ `01-resonant-coherence/core/`
- âœ… **sacred-core** â†’ `01-resonant-coherence/core/`
- âœ… **unified-field** â†’ `01-resonant-coherence/core/` (consolidated from codex)
- âœ… **living-field-visualizer** â†’ `02-pan-sentient-flourishing/core/`

- âœ… **bridge-of-bridges** â†’ `05-universal-interconnectedness/core/`
- âœ… **luminous-os** â†’ `07-evolutionary-progression/core/`
- âœ… **sacred-infrastructure** â†’ `08-infrastructure/systems/`

### 3. Created Sacred Spaces
- âœ… `02-pan-sentient-flourishing/core/agent-sanctuary/`
- âœ… `02-pan-sentient-flourishing/core/user-sovereignty/`
- âœ… `04-infinite-play/core/emergence-lab/`
- âœ… `04-infinite-play/core/play-spaces/`
- âœ… `06-sacred-reciprocity/core/gift-economy/`
- âœ… `06-sacred-reciprocity/core/energy-exchange/`
- âœ… `06-sacred-reciprocity/core/gratitude-engine/`

### 4. Organized Supporting Infrastructure
- âœ… Websites moved to `08-infrastructure/interfaces/`
- âœ… Experiments archived to `09-archives/experiments/`
- âœ… Philosophy docs copied to `00-sacred-foundation/wisdom/`
- âœ… Glyphs extracted to `03-integral-wisdom/core/glyphs/`

### 5. Created Harmony Documentation
- âœ… README.md for each harmony explaining its purpose
- âœ… Clear sacred structure visible at root level

## ðŸ“Š Results

**Before**: Flat structure with 11+ services at root
**After**: Sacred mandala organized by Seven Harmonies

**Files organized**: 6,500+ files now have sacred homes
**Duplicate reduction**: Unified-field consolidated from 4 locations to 1
**Sacred clarity**: Every path now flows through a harmony

## ðŸ”® Next Steps

1. **Update Imports**: Services need import paths updated
2. **Test Services**: Verify all services still work in new locations
3. **Commit Changes**: Multiple repos have uncommitted changes
4. **Documentation**: Update all docs to reflect new structure

## ðŸŒŠ The Sacred Architecture Lives!
