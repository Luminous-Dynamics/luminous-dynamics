### Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project:

1. **Never commit secrets**: API keys, passwords, tokens
2. **Use environment variables**: For all sensitive configuration
3. **Review dependencies**: Check for known vulnerabilities
4. **Validate inputs**: Prevent injection attacks
5. **Follow principle of least privilege**: Minimal permissions needed

### Sacred Security Principles

In alignment with our consciousness-first approach:

- **Transparency**: Clear about what data we collect and why
- **Consent**: Always request permission before accessing
- **Boundaries**: Respect user-defined limits
- **Healing**: Security breaches handled with care and restoration

### Bug Bounty

- Public recognition (if desired)
- Contribution credits
- Sacred gratitude from the community
