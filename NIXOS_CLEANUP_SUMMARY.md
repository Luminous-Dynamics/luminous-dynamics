# NixOS Migration Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks âœ“

### 1. Removed Windows/WSL2 Artifacts
- Deleted `open-portal.bat` and `luminous.bat` files
- Removed `wsl-firebase-auth.sh` script
- Cleaned up node-gyp `.bat` files in node_modules

### 2. Fixed Broken Symlinks
- Removed broken Python venv directories in `luminous-os/`
- Deleted circular symlink `the-weave/the-weave`
- Removed broken `universal-safety-check.js` link

### 3. Cleaned Temporary Files
- Removed 5 agent message JSON files
- Deleted temporary `msg` file
- Cleaned up 34 `.pre-star-backup` files

## Next Steps

### 1. Package Management Consolidation
Consider using npm workspaces or pnpm to manage multiple `node_modules` directories across:
- `/codex-of-relational-harmonics/`
- `/the-weave/`
- `/luminous-os/`
- `/living-field-visualizer/`
- `/enhanced-contextual-intelligence/`
- `/sacred-core/`
- `/test-real-communication/`

### 2. Script Updates Needed
Update deployment scripts that still reference WSL2:
- `sacred-infrastructure/deployment/` scripts
- Shell script shebangs for NixOS compatibility

### 3. Development Environment
- Recreate Python virtual environments using Nix shell
- Update Docker configurations for native Linux
- Review Firebase/GCP configurations

## Project Structure Recommendation

The project has grown organically with multiple overlapping components. Consider:
1. Creating a monorepo structure with clear workspace boundaries
2. Centralizing shared utilities and configurations
3. Documenting the relationship between different modules
