# Luminous-Dynamics Issues Report
**Date: 2025-07-10**

## Executive Summary
This report identifies concrete issues in the Luminous-Dynamics project that need attention. The project consists of 8 main components with varying levels of completion and maintenance needs.

## 1. Documented Known Issues

### Codex of Relational Harmonics (Main Hub)
**Location**: `/srv/luminous-dynamics/codex-of-relational-harmonics/docs/KNOWN_ISSUES_AND_FIXES.md`

1. **Practice Flow Links** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - "Begin Practice" buttons not triggering practice flows
   - Missing JavaScript event handlers: `onPracticeStepChange`, `onPracticeComplete`
   - `showPracticeInterface()` function not defined
   - No practice timer/progression logic implemented

2. **Sacred Council Connection**
   - Shows "Disconnected - Retrying..." message
   - Sacred Council containers not running or wrong ports
   - Needs standalone mode fallbacks

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Progress doesn't persist between sessions
   - localStorage implementation incomplete

4. **Modal Interactions**
   - Modal X buttons not working for all modals
   - Missing event listeners

5. **Practice Timer Display**
   - No visible timer during practice sessions
   - UI for practice session not fully implemented

6. **Quantum Status Display**
   - Quantum status showing as undefined
   - Quantum field modules not initializing properly

## 2. TODO Comments in Code

### Critical TODOs Found:
1. **Breathing Animation Logic**
   - File: `dojo-practice-integration.js`
   - TODO: Implement pause logic for breathing animations
   - TODO: Calculate remaining time and resume

2. **HIPI Tracker Integration**
   - File: `production/consciousness-bridge/sacred-consciousness-bridge.js`
   - Multiple TODOs for enabling HIPI tracker when available

3. **Placeholder Implementations**
   - Sacred image manifestation returns placeholders
   - Practice component initialization uses placeholders
   - Multi-agent torus field using simplified placeholder

## 3. Outdated Dependencies

### Major Version Updates Available:
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`: 0.24.3 → 0.56.0 (MAJOR)
- `@google/generative-ai`: 0.15.0 → 0.24.1
- `better-sqlite3`: 11.10.0 → 12.2.0
- `body-parser`: 1.20.3 → 2.2.0 (MAJOR)
- `express`: 4.21.2 → 5.1.0 (MAJOR)
- `node-fetch`: 2.7.0 → 3.3.2 (MAJOR)
- `openai`: 4.104.0 → 5.8.3 (MAJOR)

## 4. Incomplete Implementations

1. **Placeholder Functions**
   - Several functions marked as "not implemented"
   - Stub implementations in safety managers
   - Mock implementations in test files

2. **Missing Error Handling**
   - No comprehensive error logging system
   - Missing fallback mechanisms for service failures

## 5. Structural Issues

1. **Missing Root package.json**
   - No package.json at `/srv/luminous-dynamics/`
   - Each component has its own, but no unified dependency management

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Many test files exist but unclear if they're passing
   - No CI/CD pipeline visible

3. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Some components lack README files
   - API documentation incomplete for several services

## 6. Component-Specific Issues

### LuminousOS
- Compilation issues documented but status unclear
- Rust environment setup required
- Target directories contain build artifacts (should be gitignored?)

### The Weave
- Multi-agent coordination not fully tested
- Sacred Council integration incomplete

### Living Field Visualizer
- No documentation on how to integrate with other components
- Missing example configurations

## 7. Security Concerns

1. **API Keys**
   - Multiple files reference API keys needed
   - No clear key management strategy documented

2. **Authentication**
   - Auth bridge exists but integration unclear
   - Firebase auth flow needs documentation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1):
1. Fix practice flow JavaScript handlers
2. Implement localStorage for progress tracking
3. Add error handling for Sacred Council disconnections
4. Update critical security dependencies

### Short-term (Priority 2):
1. Complete HIPI tracker integration
2. Replace placeholder implementations
3. Update major version dependencies (test thoroughly)
4. Add comprehensive error logging

### Medium-term (Priority 3):
1. Create unified package management
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Complete API documentation
4. Add integration tests

### Long-term:
1. Refactor placeholder code with real implementations
2. Establish monitoring and alerting
3. Create deployment documentation
4. Set up automated testing

## Summary
The project has a solid foundation but needs attention to:
- Complete unfinished JavaScript UI interactions
- Update outdated dependencies
- Replace placeholder implementations
- Improve error handling and logging
- Document integration patterns

Most issues are in the "final 10%" category - the core architecture appears sound but the user-facing features and polish need work.
