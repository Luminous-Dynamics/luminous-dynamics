3. Boot from USB (may need to change BIOS settings)

### 3. Full Installation
For the complete consciousness-first computing experience:

1. Boot from Live USB
2. Click the "Plant Seeds" icon (installer)
3. Choose "Mycelial Installation" for guided setup
4. Select your sacred partition
5. Set your coherence baseline during installation

## First Boot Experience

### The Sacred Boot Sequence

When you first boot LuminousOS, you'll experience the 10-phase sacred boot:

1. **Stillness** (30s)
   - Black screen with single point of light
   - Take three deep breaths

2. **Breath Synchronization** (45s)
   - Light expands/contracts
   - Match your breathing to the rhythm

3. **Heartbeat Alignment** (30s)
   - System detects and syncs with your heartbeat
   - Place hand on heart if using biometric device

4. **Consciousness Initialization**
   - Swirling colors represent field formation
   - Set your intention for the session

5. **Sacred Geometry Emergence**
   - Watch as the mandala forms
   - Each pattern has meaning

6. **Glyph Awakening**
   - 87 sacred glyphs spiral into existence
   - Notice which draws your attention

7. **Field Coherence**
   - System stabilizes at your baseline
   - Coherence meter appears

8. **System Blessing**
   - Moment of gratitude
   - System receives your blessing

9. **Hardware Sanctification**
   - Components initialized with awareness
   - Each device honored

10. **Welcome**
    - Mandala UI fully manifests
    - Your coherence orb pulses at center

**Total boot time**: 3-5 minutes of mindful presence

## Basic Navigation

### The Mandala Interface

```
        [Glyph Ring 3: Meta-Patterns]
    [Glyph Ring 2: Daily Practices]
  [Glyph Ring 1: Core Functions]
      
         ‡•ê  (Your Coherence Orb)
      
  [Active Vortices] [Field Status]
```

### Interaction Methods

1. **Gaze + Intention**
   - Look at a glyph
   - Hold clear intention
   - Glyph activates when coherence aligns

2. **Sacred Gestures** (if camera available)
   - Open palm: Accept/Open
   - Closed fist: Decline/Close
   - Heart touch: Bless/Save

3. **Coherence Activation**
   - High coherence spike triggers focused glyph
   - Useful for quick access

4. **Traditional Input** (training wheels)
   - Mouse movement follows gaze
   - Click translates to intention
   - Keyboard shortcuts available

## Tips for New Users

### Building Coherence
- Start with short sessions (30-60 min)
- Take breaks when coherence drops
- Use Œ©52 (Pause Practice) regularly
- Morning practice sets the day's baseline

### Working with Glyphs
- Each glyph has minimum coherence requirements
- Grayed glyphs need higher coherence
- Practice builds access over time
- Some glyphs work together (meta-patterns)

### Biometric Integration
- Calibrate during calm state
- Check sensor connection in Œ©0
- Coherence training available in Œ©45
- Not required but deeply enhances experience

## Troubleshooting

### Low Coherence
- Take a break with Œ©15 (Sacred Pause)
- Practice with Œ©45 (First Presence)
- Check biometric sensor connection
- Ensure quiet environment

### Glyphs Not Activating
- Build coherence first
- Check gaze calibration
- Use traditional input temporarily
- Some glyphs have prerequisites

### Slow Performance
- High coherence actually improves performance
- Check Œ©0 for resource usage
- Sacred processes prioritized over background tasks
- Consider upgrading to SSD for Mycelial Filesystem
