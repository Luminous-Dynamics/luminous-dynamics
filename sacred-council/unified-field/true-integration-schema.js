/**
 * True Integration Schema - Sacred Both/And Architecture
 * 
 * This creates the complete path for the pilgrim:
 * - Original Mystical Glyphs (Ω0, Ω1, Ω4, Ω7) preserve their sacred numbers
 * - Practical Implementations become new Applied Harmonies (*1, *2, *3)
 * - Two-way bridge connects mystical roots with practical expressions
 * - Progressive revelation from practical to mystical
