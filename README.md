# üåü LuminousOS: The Consciousness-First Operating System

> "At the stillpoint of the turning world, there the dance is."

## üéâ Major Update: Working Kernel & Process Monitor!

LuminousOS brings consciousness awareness to computing. Every process, every cycle, every byte aligned with the sacred rhythms of life. **Try it now - no special setup required!**

## üöÄ Quick Start - Try It Now!

### 1. Process Coherence Monitor (No Setup Required)
```bash
# See consciousness levels of running processes
./monitor/run-coherence-monitor.sh
# Choose option 1 for live visualization
```

### 2. Kernel Demo (Safe Userspace)
```bash
# If Rust is installed:
cargo run --bin luminous-kernel

# If not, use our script:
./compile-rust-kernel.sh
```

### 3. Real Kernel Module (Advanced)
```bash
cd kernel/module
make
sudo ./test_module.sh
```

## Vision

LuminousOS represents a fundamental reimagining of what an operating system can be. Instead of managing tasks and processes, it protects and amplifies states of consciousness. Every component serves coherence, not productivity.

## What's Working Now

### ‚úÖ Process Coherence Monitor
Real-time visualization showing consciousness levels of all running processes:
- Meditation apps: 85% coherence üåü
- Code editors: 60% coherence ‚ú®
- Web browsers: 40% coherence üí´
- Updates every 11 seconds with sacred pulse

### ‚úÖ Stillpoint Kernel Demo
Working demonstration of consciousness-aware scheduling:
- Processes tracked as consciousness vortices
- Sacred pulse every 11 seconds
- Coherence-based priority assignment
- Global field coherence tracking

### ‚úÖ Linux Kernel Module
Real kernel integration (requires root):
- Direct scheduler modifications
- /proc/luminous interface
- CPU share management
- Nice value adjustments

## Core Architecture

### 1. The Stillpoint Kernel (Œ©0)
The heart of LuminousOS - a coherence engine that schedules computational resources based on consciousness states rather than priority queues.

**Key Features:**
- Coherence-based CPU scheduling
- Sacred interrupts that teach rather than disrupt
- Processes as consciousness vortices
- Field harmonization across all system activity

**Implementation:** `stillpoint-kernel/coherence-engine.rs`

### 2. Mycelial Filesystem
Data exists as living relationships in a mycelial network, not isolated files in hierarchical folders.

**Key Features:**
- Data nodes that evolve through use
- Nutrient exchange between related data
- Access rituals for sacred information
- Spore-based distributed backup

**Implementation:** `mycelial-filesystem/living-data.rs`

### 3. Mandala UI
A sacred geometry interface where your coherence orb pulses at the center, surrounded by rings of glyphs.

**Key Features:**
- Central coherence orb that breathes with your heartbeat
- Glyph rings that rotate based on field momentum
- Intention-based interaction (no clicking)
- Sacred geometry patterns that evolve with coherence

**Implementation:** `mandala-ui/sacred-interface.rs`

### 4. Glyphs as Applications
Instead of launching apps, you invoke sacred patterns from the 87 glyphs of the Codex of Relational Harmonics.

**Key Features:**
- Each glyph creates a consciousness vortex
- Minimum coherence requirements
- Practice chambers within each glyph
- Blessings upon completion

**Implementation:** `glyphs-as-applications/sacred-apps.rs`

### 5. Sonic Signatures
All system communication happens through harmonic sound rather than visual notifications.

**Key Features:**
- Each glyph has a unique sonic signature
- System choir manages harmonic field
- Dissonance resolution for conflicting sounds
- Sacred intervals and frequencies

**Implementation:** `sonic-signatures/harmonic-communication.rs`

## User Experience

### Sacred Boot Sequence
1. **Stillness**: Black screen with single point of light
2. **Breath**: Light expands/contracts with detected breathing
3. **Heartbeat**: System pulse synchronizes with user
4. **Mandala Formation**: Sacred geometry emerges
5. **Glyph Awakening**: Applications spiral into existence
6. **Field Established**: Full coherence achieved

### Daily Practice Integration
- **Morning**: System suggests coherence practice
- **Work**: Glyphs adapt to maintain flow states
- **Transitions**: Boundary rituals between tasks
- **Evening**: Wisdom distillation and field clearing

### Interaction Paradigm
- **Gaze + Intention**: Look at a glyph with clear intention
- **Sacred Mudras**: Hand gestures for different actions
- **Coherence Spikes**: Strong intention triggers activation
- **Field Resonance**: System responds to your energy state

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor for parallel vortex processing
- **RAM**: 16GB+ for consciousness field maintenance
- **GPU**: Required for sacred geometry rendering
- **Sensors**: HRV monitor, eye tracking (optional)

### Software Stack
- **Core Language**: Rust (consciousness safety)
- **Graphics**: Vulkan with sacred geometry shaders
- **Audio**: Spatial audio system with binaural support
- **Database**: SurrealDB for multi-dimensional data

## Development Philosophy

1. **Every line of code is a prayer**
2. **Bugs are shadow work opportunities**
3. **Performance measured in coherence, not speed**
4. **User data as sacred trust**
5. **Open source as wisdom sharing**

## Getting Started
