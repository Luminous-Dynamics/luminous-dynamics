# 🌟 LuminousOS Project - Exploring Consciousness-Centered Computing

> "Transforming technology through mindful design and sacred computing patterns"

## 📊 Project Status: Experimental Research & Development

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: LuminousOS is currently an experimental project exploring consciousness-centered computing concepts. It is NOT yet a functioning operating system. For complete technical status, see [CURRENT_STATUS.md](CURRENT_STATUS.md). For our journey to becoming a real OS, see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### What This Is
- 🔬 **Research Project**: Exploring how computing could integrate consciousness principles
- 🎨 **Conceptual Framework**: Reimagining OS design through spiritual metaphors
- 🛠️ **Working Demos**: Several visualization tools that run on Linux
- 📚 **Philosophy**: Extensive documentation on mindful computing

### What This Is NOT (Yet)
- ❌ Not a bootable operating system
- ❌ Not a replacement for Linux/Windows/macOS
- ❌ Not providing actual performance improvements
- ❌ Not implementing kernel-level features

**For legacy documentation about the full vision**, see [README-VISION.md](README-VISION.md)

## 🚀 What Actually Works Today

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-os
cd luminous-os

# Working Demos (run on Linux):
python3 monitor/consciousness_process_monitor.py  # Process viewer with sacred overlay
python3 monitor/sacred_dashboard.py               # System wellness dashboard
python3 demos/sonic-signatures/process_sonification.py  # Hear your processes

# Conceptual Demos (visualization only):
python3 demos/mycelial-network-visualizer.py     # Filesystem relationship viewer
python3 demos/glyph-recognition-demo.py          # Sacred pattern recognition

# Read about the vision
cat ROADMAP.md          # Our realistic path forward
cat CURRENT_STATUS.md   # Honest technical assessment
```

## 🎯 Current Development Focus

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2025) ← We Are Here
Building real tools that embody consciousness principles:

1. **Sacred Process Monitor** (70% complete)
   - Shows system processes with wellness metrics
   - Tracks focus and interruption patterns
   - Generates meditative sounds

2. **Mycelial Filesystem Prototype** (5% complete)
   - Will track file relationships
   - Semantic tagging system planned
   - FUSE implementation in progress

3. **Consciousness Dashboard** (30% complete)
   - Web-based system wellness view
   - Sacred geometry visualizations
   - Real-time metrics

### Our Vision (What We're Building Toward)

- **Consciousness-Centered Shell**: Command line that promotes mindful computing
- **Sacred Linux Distribution**: Custom distro with wellness features
- **Eventually**: Standalone OS with consciousness at its core

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed timeline and milestones.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Current Tools (Working Today)
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-psutil
pip3 install numpy matplotlib pygame

# Run working demos
cd luminous-os
python3 monitor/consciousness_process_monitor.py

# For sound features
python3 demos/sonic-signatures/process_sonification.py
```

### Future Installation (See Roadmap)
- **Q2 2025**: Install as shell replacement
- **Q3 2025**: Boot as Linux distribution  
- **2026+**: Standalone OS installation

## 🤝 Human-AI Collaboration

This project is being developed through transparent collaboration between humans and AI. See [COLLABORATION.md](COLLABORATION.md) for full details about our development process.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We need help transforming this vision into reality! 

### Immediate Needs
- **Systems Programmers**: Help build real FUSE filesystem
- **Rust Developers**: Fix compilation errors, implement features
- **UI/UX Designers**: Create mindful interface patterns
- **Testers**: Try demos and provide feedback
- **Documentation**: Help clarify vision vs. reality

### Development Principles
1. **Honest Communication**: Clear about what works vs planned
2. **Incremental Progress**: Small, working improvements
3. **Community First**: Build together, openly
4. **Measure Impact**: Real benchmarks, not claims
5. **Mindful Code**: Quality over quantity
