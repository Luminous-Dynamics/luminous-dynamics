## Architecture

Sacred Shell is built as a wrapper around your existing shell (bash/zsh) that:
1. Intercepts commands before execution
2. Tracks wellness metrics
3. Provides mindful prompts and pauses
4. Maintains command history with context

## Philosophy

"Every keystroke is an opportunity for mindfulness. Every command is a chance to check in with yourself."
