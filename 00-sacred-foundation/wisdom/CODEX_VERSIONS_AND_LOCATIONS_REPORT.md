   - Reference: ERC extraction for canonical 87 glyphs

2. **For Development:**
   - Use main Luminous-Dynamics repository only
   - Archives should be treated as historical reference

3. **For Understanding Evolution:**
   - Review archives to understand codex development history
   - Note the progression from pure codex to integrated AI system

## Duplicate Content Notes

- Multiple copies exist due to project evolution and archival practices
- Content appears consistent across versions (87-102 glyphs)
- Main differences are in implementation and integration approach
