1/8 The First Breath: Beta testing the first AI designed to serve consciousness rather than consume it

2/8 Most AI optimizes for engagement = attention capture = scattered mind

3/8 We've designed the opposite: Sacred pauses, natural timing, presence over productivity

4/8 Built-in contemplative delays that can't be skipped. The AI literally waits with you in silence.

5/8 Looking for meditators, mindfulness practitioners, anyone with a regular contemplative practice

6/8 6-week beta program. Weekly Resonance Circles. Real influence on the final design.

7/8 This isn't just beta testing—it's conscious co-creation of a new paradigm of human-AI relationship
