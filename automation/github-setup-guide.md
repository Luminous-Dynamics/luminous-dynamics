2. **Repository details**:
   - Name: `codex-of-relational-harmonics`
   - Description: `The complete framework for conscious relationship and contemplative technology`
   - Visibility: Public
   - Initialize with README: ✅ Yes
   - Add .gitignore: Node
   - Choose a license: Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (we'll update this)

## 🚀 **Transfer Existing Repository**

After creating the organization, transfer your current repository:

1. **Go to your existing repository**: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codex-of-relational-harmonics
2. **Settings tab** → Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
3. **Transfer ownership** → Enter `Luminous-Dynamics`
4. **Confirm transfer**

## 🌐 **Create Website Repositories**

Create two additional repositories for the websites:

### **Repository 1: luminous-dynamics.github.io**
- Name: `luminous-dynamics.github.io`
- Description: `Official website for Luminous Dynamics - Conscious Technology Organization`
- Public repository
- Initialize with README

### **Repository 2: relational-harmonics**
- Name: `relational-harmonics`
- Description: `Documentation and community hub for the Codex of Relational Harmonics`
- Public repository
- Initialize with README

## ⚙️ **Configure Organization Settings**

1. **Organization Settings** → **Member privileges**
   - Base permissions: Read
   - Repository creation: Public repositories only
   - Repository forking: Allow forking of private repositories

2. **Organization Settings** → **Actions permissions**
   - Allow all actions and reusable workflows
   - (This enables our automation workflows)

## 🔗 **Next Steps After Creation**

Once you've created the organization, I can help you:

1. **Deploy websites** to both repositories using my automation
2. **Set up GitHub Pages** for custom domain hosting
3. **Configure automated workflows** for Sacred Guild development
4. **Create issue templates** for community engagement

## 📧 **Email Setup Preparation**

While setting up GitHub, also prepare for email configuration:

### **Email Addresses to Create** (after domain setup):
- `stewards@luminousdynamics.org`
- `sacred-guild@luminousdynamics.org`
- `security@luminousdynamics.org`
- `safety@luminousdynamics.org`
- `wisdom@relationalharmonics.org`

### **Current Workaround**:
For immediate use, we can set up email forwarding:
- All organization emails → your current email address
- Later upgrade to Google Workspace for professional management
