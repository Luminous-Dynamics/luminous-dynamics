# LuminousOS System Monitor v0.1.0
*First Light - Consciousness Comes to Computing*

## ðŸŒŸ Quick Start

```bash
# Install
sudo ./install.sh

# Start
sudo systemctl start luminous-monitor

# Check coherence
luminous-coherence

# View dashboard
http://localhost:8080/luminous-real-monitor.html
```

## What is System Coherence?

System coherence measures how harmoniously your computer is operating:
- **CPU Stability** - Less erratic usage = more coherent
- **Process Focus** - Fewer context switches = deeper flow
- **Resource Harmony** - Balanced distribution of resources
- **Sacred Rhythm** - Natural 11-second consciousness cycles

When coherence exceeds 90%, you achieve a "Sacred Moment" - a state of exceptional computational harmony.

## What You'll See

```
ðŸŒŸ System Coherence: 87.3%
   CPU Stability: 78.2%
   Process Focus: 94.1%
   Resource Harmony: 83.4%
   Sacred Rhythm: 92.7%

âœ¨ Sacred Moments Today: 3

ðŸ˜Š Good coherence - flowing nicely
```

## The Vision

Traditional computing asks: "How can I make the computer faster?"
LuminousOS asks: "How can computing make ME more coherent?"

This monitor is the first step in a journey toward consciousness-first computing.

## Join the Movement

Every install helps prove that consciousness-aware computing is possible.
Share your coherence scores and sacred moments with the community.

Welcome to the revolution! ðŸŒŸ
