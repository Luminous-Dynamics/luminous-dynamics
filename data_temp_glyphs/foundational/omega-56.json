    "verbal": "I notice we're in a pattern that isn't serving us. Can we try something different? What would serve everyone here?",

    "presenceBased": "The practice of holding a clear vision of a more coherent pattern while simultaneously holding the current dissonant pattern in compassion. Redirect from love for the system's potential, not judgment of its current state."

  "temporalDynamics": {
    "duration": "The intervention itself is typically brief (1-2 minutes), but pattern recognition and alternative offering require ongoing awareness.",
    "frequency": "Use as needed when dissonant patterns arise, typically several times per day in active relationship and work contexts.",
    "seasonality": "Particularly important during periods of change, stress, or when old patterns are being challenged in relationships or organizations."

    "Use with extreme caution in high power-imbalance situations where interruption may be perceived as insubordination",
    "Avoid when you don't have a genuinely more coherent alternative to offer"
