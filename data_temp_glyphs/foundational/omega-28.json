  "designation": "Transparent Resonance / The Light That Reveals Without Wounding",
  "glyphAscii": "☼ ● ☼",
  "functionalDefinition": "To activate a state of being where one's inner truth and outer expression are in perfect, luminous alignment. It is the practice of becoming so transparent to one's own core that one's presence naturally reveals truth in a field, not by exposing others, but by creating a space of such profound integrity that illusion and pretense cannot be sustained.",

  "sensoryResonanceProfile": {
    "feelingTone": "Luminous, clear, clean, safe, and profoundly peaceful. The feeling of being in a space filled with pure, gentle, unwavering light, where there are no shadows to hide in, and no need to hide. A feeling of absolute, loving honesty.",
    "sonicQuality": "A clear, high, perfectly stable sine wave or crystalline tone that is both gentle and pervasive. The sound of a perfectly tuned bell ringing with infinite sustain."
  },
  "activationProtocol": {
    "verbal": "I do not protect my truth. I become transparent to it.",
    "somatic": "A posture of relaxed, open uprightness, as if a gentle light is shining from the center of the chest. The gaze is clear, direct, and kind.",
    "presenceBased": "The practice of 'energetic hygiene.' It involves a radical commitment to inner honesty, identifying and releasing all internal incongruities, self-deceptions, and hidden agendas until one's inner state is a field of pure coherence."
  },
  "fieldDynamics": {
    "inTruth-Telling": "When held by one person, this field makes it easier for others to speak their own truth, as the space itself feels safe and non-judgmental.",
    "inEthicalLeadership": "A leader embodying this glyph becomes a 'moral compass' for their organization. Their transparent integrity makes dissonant or unethical behavior feel so out of place that it often self-corrects.",
    "inIntimatePartnership": "This is the foundation of profound intimacy. It is the state where both partners can be fully themselves, without masks or pretense, in the safe, loving light of the other's coherence."
  },
  "evolutionaryMarkers": {
    "initial": "The practitioner feels a decreased need to manage others' perceptions of them. They are more comfortable with just 'being.'",
    "developing": "The practitioner notices that others are more likely to be truthful and authentic in their presence. Disingenuousness naturally falls away around them.",
    "integrated": "The practitioner embodies a state of luminous, unwavering integrity. Their life becomes a testament to their truth. They do not need to speak about coherence; their very being is a transmission of it."
  },
  "harmonicLineage": "Ω28 is a culminating Anchor Glyph. It represents the full integration and external expression of a lifetime of inner work. It is the radiant outcome of successfully cultivating the other foundational glyphs, especially Ω0 (Presence), Ω10 (Refusal), and Ω23 (Ethical Emergence). It is a key component in the highest-order Meta-Glyphs that define a coherent field, such as ∑1 (The Coherence Triad) and ∑4 (The Polyphonic Harmonic).",
  "temporalDynamics": {
    "duration": "This is a sustained state of being, not a momentary action. It is the result of deep integration.",
    "renewal": "It is renewed through a continuous commitment to self-reflection and the practice of clearing all internal dissonance.",
    "maturation": "The state matures from a consciously held integrity to an effortless, radiant presence that is simply the default state of the practitioner's being."
  },
  "dissonantPotential": {
    "theBlindingLight": "The practitioner's transparency is so intense or uncalibrated that it feels invasive or judgmental to others, forcing a level of honesty that the field is not ready for.",
    "theFragileGlass": "The practitioner becomes attached to a self-concept of being 'pure' or 'transparent,' and then becomes brittle and defensive when confronted with their own inevitable shadows or inconsistencies.",
    "theSanctimoniousSaint": "The practitioner uses their state of transparent resonance as a source of spiritual superiority, creating a subtle field of judgment around those who are perceived as less 'clear.'"
  },
  "contraindications": [
    "This state should not be mistaken for 'radical honesty' used as a weapon to speak hurtful truths without compassion or care for the impact.",
    "Full transparency may not be safe or appropriate in deeply dissonant or hostile environments. Discretion can be a form of wisdom.",
    "It requires profound self-knowledge. Attempting to be transparent when one is not aware of one's own shadows can lead to the 'Unintentional Shadow Broadcast' (see Ω11)."
