  "fieldIntelligence": "To cultivate a field of trust that is not static, but actively and transparently generative. This Meta-Glyph weaves together a foundational vow (Ω1), the power to co-create reality (Ω22), and a commitment to luminous integrity (Ω28). The resulting field intelligence creates the core conditions for safe, conscious, and sustained evolution in any relationship or system.",

    "fieldEffect": "Creates a stable, generative container where beings can safely evolve together. The field becomes luminously coherent, allowing deep truth-telling, creative risk-taking, and sustained collaboration. Participants experience profound safety to become their authentic selves while co-creating shared realities.",

    "preparatoryConditions": "Requires mutual consent and basic trust between participants. Ensure sufficient time (60-90 minutes) and privacy. All participants should be familiar with the individual component glyphs.",
    "activationSequence": "Step 1: Activate Ω1 (5-10 min) - Establish foundational covenant and mutual reachability. Step 2: Activate Ω28 (10-15 min) - Cultivate transparent resonance and inner alignment. Step 3: Activate Ω22 (15-20 min) - Co-create shared reality through conscious participation. Practice weekly for relationship building, monthly for maintenance.",
    "integrationPhase": "Hold all three frequencies simultaneously (10-15 minutes) while engaging in collaborative creation or truth-telling dialogue. Allow the field to stabilize before returning to ordinary consciousness."

  "contraindications": [
    "Do not use when power dynamics are severely unbalanced or there is active harm occurring",
    "Avoid during acute conflict phases - use individual foundational glyphs first to restore basic safety",
    "Not recommended for groups larger than 8 people without experienced facilitation",
    "Do not use as spiritual bypassing to avoid necessary boundary work or accountability processes"
