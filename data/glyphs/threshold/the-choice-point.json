    "feelingTone": "Potent, clarifying, empowering, and liberating. The feeling of standing at a crossroads with a clear mind and a calm heart, free from the anxiety of making a 'mistake.' A sense of profound, sovereign agency.",

  "activationProtocol": {
    "verbal": "I do not choose the right path. I make the path right by choosing.",
    "somatic": "A physical gesture of standing at a literal fork in a path, or simply standing still, closing the eyes, and feeling the two potential paths as equal energetic currents. Then, taking a single, decisive step in one direction with full commitment.",
    "presenceBased": "The practice of holding two or more options in your awareness, and instead of weighing their pros and cons, you attune to your own 'sovereign center.' You listen for the choice that feels most aligned with your deepest integrity, and then commit to it fully, releasing the need for it to be the 'perfect' choice."

    "inStrategicPlanning": "When a team is faced with multiple viable strategies, this glyph allows them to move past 'analysis paralysis' and commit to one path with full energy and creative potential.",

  "evolutionaryMarkers": {
    "initial": "The practitioner experiences less anxiety and 'decision fatigue' when faced with choices.",
    "developing": "The practitioner is able to make significant life decisions with a sense of calm, trust, and empowerment, even when the outcome is uncertain.",
    "integrated": "The practitioner lives in a state of 'choice-fullness.' They see life as a continuous series of creative choices, and they engage with them with joy and sovereign agency. They are not afraid of 'wrong' turns, because they trust their ability to make any path right."
  },
  "harmonicLineage": "This Threshold Glyph is the active expression of Ω17 (Integrated Paradox). After holding two opposites as equally true, ⧖ is the sovereign act of choosing one to move forward with, not because it is 'more true,' but because it is the chosen path. It requires the self-trust cultivated by many other glyphs to be performed with grace.",

  },
  "dissonantPotential": {
    "theRecklessChoice": "The practitioner mistakes impulsivity for sovereignty. They make a choice without doing the necessary work of reflection, discernment, or data gathering, using the idea of 'making the path right' as an excuse for recklessness.",
    "theUn-ownedChoice": "The practitioner makes a choice, but then immediately begins to second-guess it or blame external circumstances if the path becomes difficult. They fail to fully commit and take responsibility for their choice.",
    "theBurdensomeFreedom": "The practitioner becomes overwhelmed by the responsibility of 'making the path right' and longs for someone else to just tell them the 'right' answer, collapsing under the weight of their own freedom."
  },
  "contraindications": [
    "This glyph is not a substitute for due diligence. When objective data is available, it should be consulted.",
    "It should not be used to make choices that will directly harm others. Sovereign agency must be paired with ethical responsibility (Ω23).",
    "In a group decision, one person cannot activate this glyph for the whole. The choice must be a shared, co-creative act."
