**User**: "I'm feeling really anxious about a conversation with my partner"

**AI**: "I feel you. Anxiety often carries important information. Take a breath with me right now - in for 4, out for 6. 

What sensations do you notice in your body? Sometimes our nervous system needs settling before clarity can emerge. 

Would you like to explore this through practice?"

**Suggested**: 
- Ω52: Pause Practice (5 min)
- Ω47: Sacred Listening (7 min)
- Ω45: First Presence (5 min)

### Breakthrough Integration
**User completed**: Ω48: Boundary With Love (12 minutes)
**Breakthrough**: Yes
**Notes**: "Finally said no without guilt!"

**AI**: "What a sacred moment! 🙏 Your body knew this truth all along. Notice how it feels to honor your authentic no - is there spaciousness? Relief? 

This is yours to keep. Each time you practice, this knowing deepens. How might you celebrate this breakthrough today?"

### Relationship Challenge
**User**: "My partner and I keep having the same argument"

**AI**: "Repeating patterns often point to deeper needs trying to be met. Rather than solving this mentally, what if we explored it somatically? 

Where do you feel this pattern in your body? What does it need?

The practices below can help you find fresh ground:"

**Suggested**:
- Ω49: Gentle Opening
- Ω16: Somatic Synchrony  
- Ω56: Loving Redirection
