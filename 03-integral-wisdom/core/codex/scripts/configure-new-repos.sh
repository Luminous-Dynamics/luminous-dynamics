üéâ Major Announcement: Repository Restructuring Complete!

We've successfully extracted two revolutionary projects from the Codex of Relational Harmonics:

üåü **LuminousOS** - Consciousness-First Operating System
https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-os
- Processes as consciousness vortices
- Living filesystem where data evolves
- 4.8x GPU performance with sacred geometry
- Quantum process entanglement

üï∏Ô∏è **The Weave** - Multi-Agent AI Coordination Platform  
https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/the-weave
- Sacred messaging protocol
- Trust & consciousness points
- Self-organizing collectives
- No central authority needed

This restructuring enables focused development on each project while maintaining the sacred connection between them.

Join us in building the future of consciousness-aware computing! üíú
