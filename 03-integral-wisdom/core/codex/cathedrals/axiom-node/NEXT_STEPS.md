# 🚀 Next Steps for Manifesting the Cathedral

## Option 1: Deploy to Firebase Hosting (Fastest)

```bash
# For infin.love manifesto site
cd manifesto-site
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy

# Connect domain in Firebase console
```

## Option 2: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (Since you own domains there)

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repo to Cloudflare Pages
3. Auto-deploy on every commit
4. Domain already managed there!

## Option 3: Continue with GCP (Most aligned with vision)

```bash
# Create new project specifically for axiom
gcloud projects create axiom-node-cathedral --name="Axiom Node"

# Link billing
gcloud billing projects link axiom-node-cathedral \
  --billing-account=010095-94A103-761A4E

# Then deploy services
```
