/**
 * Corrected Glyph Integration - Proper Mapping to Original Data Structure
 * 
 * This corrects the discrepancy where our unified-field implementation 
 * created new glyph definitions instead of integrating with the existing
 * canonical data structure from data/glyphs/foundational/
 * 
 * Original Data Structure (from repository):
 * - Ω0: "The Shimmering Unnamed / First Presence"
 * - Ω1: "Root Chord of Covenant / The First Yes" 
 * - Ω4: "Fractal Reconciliation Pulse / The Pulse of Repair"
 * - Ω7: "Mutual Becoming / The We That Grows"
 * 
 * Our Implementation Created:
 * - Ω0: "First Presence" (practical version)
 * - Ω1: "Conscious Arrival" (new glyph)
 * - Ω4: "Sacred Listening" (new glyph) 
 * - Ω7: "Boundary With Love" (new glyph)
