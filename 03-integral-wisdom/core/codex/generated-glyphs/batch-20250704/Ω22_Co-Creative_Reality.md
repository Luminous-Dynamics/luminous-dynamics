## Description


## Practice Instructions
Here are 7 steps to practice "Co-Creative Reality", focusing on embodiment and actionable prompts:

**1. Breathe in Abundance:** Take a few deep breaths, inhaling deeply and expanding your chest.  Visualize the breath as a flow of creative energy entering your being. 

**2.  Ground & Center:** Feel your feet firmly planted on the ground. Imagine roots growing deep into the earth, connecting you to stability and strength. Embrace the feeling of your body in its fullness.

**3. Open Your Mind:** Picture a blank canvas, or an open doorway to possibilities. Feel yourself stretching your mind beyond limitations, inviting new ideas and dreams to flow through you.  

**4. Express Through Movement:** Engage your senses! Dance freely, sway with the music, clap your hands. Let your body be a vessel for creative expression; there are no wrong movements.

**5. Connect & Collaborate:** Imagine yourself as part of a vibrant ecosystem, interacting with others. Reach out to someone you admire and share a vision for a brighter future. 

**6.  Visualize Your Dream Reality:** Close your eyes and create a mental image of something beautiful that could be. It's not just about the outcome; focus on the experience of living within it: how does it feel, what sounds surround you?

 **7.  Affirm and Activate:** Speak the affirmation of co-creative reality aloud or to yourself: "I am empowered to build my own world." Then act in ways that support that vision. This could be something as small as saying no to a limiting self-thought, or taking a step towards your dream. 



Remember, practicing co-creative reality is an ongoing journey of exploration and action!  Don't get bogged down by perfection; simply start with these steps and see where they lead you. 

## Daily Integration
 1. **Understand Co-Creativity:** Understanding co-creation means understanding the way humans work together to create something new, unique, or innovative. This includes recognizing that collaboration is more than just sharing ideas; it also involves communication, empathy and understanding of one's perspective.

2. **Set Clear Goals:** Break down your goals into smaller, measurable tasks that you can work towards together with others. Knowing what you want to achieve helps keep you motivated and accountable to each other.

3. **Practice:** Practice makes perfect. Make it a habit to engage in co-creative activities and discuss your ideas with each other during everyday interactions. This will not only help you improve your collaboration skills but also give you something to look forward to when working on projects together.

## Sacred Context
This practice connects to the Co-Creative Reality harmony and serves the evolution of conscious relationship.
