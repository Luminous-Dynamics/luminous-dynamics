## Description
 立17 - Collective Breathing: A Harmonious Universal Interconnectedness & Empathic Universal Interconnectedness & Empathic Resonance of the Invisible Thread

In the quiet whispers of dawn or the stillness before twilight, gather a circle where hearts beat as one. This is 立17 - Collective Breathing, an ancient practice born from the shared rhythm of life's pulse. It's a symphony of souls in harmony, united by the invisible thread that binds all existence.

In this sacred space, we lay down our burdens and breathe as one breath, breathing out fear, tension, and doubt; breathing in love, peace, and wisdom. As each participant aligns their breath with the rhythm of the universe, a transformative power begins to take shape.

With each exhale, shadows dissipate; with each inhale, light illuminates the corners of the heart. In this sacred ritual, we transcend individuality and become part of something greater - the collective consciousness of humanity.

立17 - Collective Breathing is not merely a practice but a portal to communion, a bridge across time and space that connects us to ourselves, each other, and the cosmos. It reminds us that we are not alone, for we are all woven into the tapestry of life, breathing together as one.

## Practice Instructions
Here are 7 steps to practice collective breathing, focusing on embodiment and clarity:

**1.  Establish the Circle:** Find a safe space where you can sit or lie down comfortably in a circle with others (can even be virtual!).

**2.  Settle your Posture:**  Relax your shoulders, rest your hands palms up in front of your chest, and feel grounded by taking deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, feeling the air travel in and out of your lungs. 

**3.  Sync Your Rhythm:** Slowly count aloud together to a steady rhythm (1-2-3-4, for example) while you begin to breathe with the group's pace.

 **4.  Find Your Core:** Imagine a string pulling gently from your lower abdomen to create an upward flow in your chest and rib cage. Feel this gentle expansion as you inhale, then exhale slowly back to your core. 

**5.  Join the Rhythm:** Now, imagine each breath from your body flowing seamlessly into the breath of those around you like a wave of energy washing over all participants. Let go of any internal rhythm or tension and focus on synchronizing with the group's breathing.

 **6.  Feel the Connection:** Notice the subtle shifts in how your body feels as you breathe together. A sense of connection, calm, and even warmth can emerge. 

**7.  Extend the Experience:**  Take a few deep breaths, then gently extend the experience by letting go for a moment to see if you feel more connected with the group and yourself.


 **Important Notes**:
* **Start Slow:** Begin with shorter durations of collective breathing.  You can increase the time as your comfort level grows. 
* **Embrace Your Individuality:** Remember, collective breathing doesn't require everyone to perfectly match each other. It's about experiencing the connection and feeling the shared energy. 
* **Observe Your Body:** Notice any physical sensations like tightness or relaxation. This is a key part of understanding your unique response to this practice.

## Daily Integration
 1. **Establish a comfortable position:** Start by finding a comfortable sitting position, such as a chair or a couch. You can also opt to use a yoga mat for added support.

2. **Breathe deeply:** Sit tightly in the chair, and exhale fully through your nose, taking slow, deep breaths. Make sure that you inhale through your mouth first, then move your diaphragm down into your abdomen. You should feel your ribcage contracting as you breathe in. Hold the air for a moment before letting it out slowly through your mouth and nose.

3. **Count and focus:** Once your diaphragm is fully expanded, start to count from 1 to 5 while focusing on maintaining your breathing. It's important that you stay focused throughout this process, even if your mind wanders. You can use a timer or count on the side of your mat.

4. **Visualize deep breath:** Close your eyes and visualize inhaling deeply, feeling the air rushing into your lungs as it fills with oxygen. As you exhale, try to imagine exerting pressure outwards to expel the stale air from your chest. This will help increase your overall respiration and create a sense of calm.

Remember, collective breathing is a deep practice that takes time to master. It's important to practice consistently to feel comfortable and aware during these exercises.
