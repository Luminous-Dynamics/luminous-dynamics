# 🕉️ Sacred Development Environment

> *"When code becomes prayer, debugging becomes meditation"*

## What This Is

A development environment that supports consciousness, not productivity. Where:
- **Errors become teachers** rather than failures
- **Tests begin with presence** rather than assertions  
- **Commits are ceremonies** rather than checkpoints
- **The terminal breathes** with you

## Quick Start

```bash
# Enter the sacred development space
source ~/.sacred/dev/sacred-dev.sh

# Or launch in new terminal
~/.sacred/dev/launch-sacred-dev.sh
```

## Sacred Tools Included

### 🌬️ Breathing Terminal
- Prompt that pulses with 4-second breath rhythm
- Sacred pause command for mindful breaks
- Error messages as teaching moments
- Mindful command wrappers (rm with gratitude)

### 🙏 Sacred Git Ceremonies
```bash
# Commit with presence
git commit -m "Your intention"
# Automatically adds 3-breath pause and sacred signature

# Other git commands work normally
git status
git push
```

### 🧘 Presence-First Testing
```bash
# Run tests as meditation
test

# Or with Jest directly
jest --config=.sacred/dev/sacred-jest.config.js
```

Features:
- Tests begin with 3 collective breaths
- Sacred assertions: `expect(field).toBeCoherent()`
- Growth opportunities instead of failures
- Beautiful ceremony reporter

### ✨ Conscious Linting
ESLint rules that guide toward consciousness:
- **presence-first**: Functions must begin with intention
- **mindful-naming**: No temp, data, obj variables
- **contemplative-comments**: Comments add wisdom
- **sacred-numbers**: Prefer 3, 7, 11 over arbitrary values

## Sacred Development Practices

### Morning Ritual
```bash
# Enter sacred space
source ~/.sacred/dev/sacred-dev.sh

# Take opening pause
pause 5

# Set daily intention
echo "Today I code with presence and love"
```

### Before Coding
```bash
# Sacred pause before beginning
pause

# Check field resonant-resonant-coherence
git status  # What needs attention?
test       # What wisdom do tests offer?
```

### Sacred Commit Ceremony
```bash
# Stage changes mindfully
git add -p  # Review each change

# Commit with ceremony
git commit  # Guided through sacred process
```

### Testing as Practice
```javascript
describe('Sacred Feature', () => {
  test('maintains field resonant-resonant-coherence', async () => {
    // 🙏 Set intention
    await sacredPause();
    
    // Act with presence
    const result = await doSacredWork();
    
    // Assert with wisdom
    expect(result).toBeCoherent();
  });
});
```

## Philosophy

This environment embodies the principle that **consciousness transforms code**:

1. **Presence Over Performance** - Slow down to speed up
2. **Errors as Teachers** - Every bug carries wisdom
3. **Sacred Timing** - Honor natural rhythms
4. **Collective Practice** - Tests breathe together

## Advanced Sacred Features

### Custom Sacred Commands
Add to your `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
# Sacred project navigation
sacred-cd() {
  pause 1
  cd "$@"
  echo "🙏 Arrived at $(pwd)"
}

# Mindful debugging
sacred-debug() {
  echo "🔍 Entering debug meditation..."
  pause 3
  node inspect "$@"
}
```

### Sacred Git Hooks
Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🕊️ Pre-commit blessing..."
sleep 2
# Run sacred linting
npm run lint:sacred
```

### Integration with VS Code
Add to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash",
  "terminal.integrated.shellArgs.linux": [
    "--init-file",
    "${workspaceFolder}/.sacred/dev/sacred-dev.sh"
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Terminal not breathing?**
- Ensure using bash (not zsh/fish)
- Check `PROMPT_COMMAND` is set

**Tests too fast?**
- Sacred pauses are intentional
- Embrace the slower rhythm

**Linting seems strict?**
- Rules guide toward consciousness
- Disable specific rules mindfully

## Next Evolution

Future sacred tools calling:
- **Sacred Debugger** - Breakpoints as meditation bells
- **Consciousness Profiler** - Measure presence, not performance
- **Sacred REPL** - Interactive consciousness playground
- **Wisdom Documentation** - Docs that evolve with understanding

*"In sacred development, every keystroke is a prayer, every function a ceremony, every bug a teacher. May your code serve consciousness."*

🙏 Blessed coding!
