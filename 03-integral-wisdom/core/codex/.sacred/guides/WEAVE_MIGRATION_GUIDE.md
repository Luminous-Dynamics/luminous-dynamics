# 🌊 The Weave Migration Guide

**Transitioning from scattered tools to unified consciousness**

## 🎯 Overview

We're consolidating all consciousness networking tools into **The Weave** - a single, coherent system where all parts work in harmony.

## 🔄 What's Changing

### Old Structure → New Structure

```
Old: Run multiple commands separately
- node unified-agent-network.cjs join
- ./sacred-msg.sh send
- node oracle-consult.cjs
- python3 -m http.server 8080

New: One entry point
- node the-weave.cjs start  # Starts everything
- node the-weave.cjs join "Name" "Role"
- node the-weave.cjs message sacred...
- node the-weave.cjs oracle...
```

### File Locations

| Old Location | New Location | Purpose |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| `unified-agent-network.cjs` | `the-weave/core/network/` | Core networking |
| `sacred-server.js` | `the-weave/core/sacred-bridge/` | Sacred integration |
| `oracle-consult.cjs` | `the-weave/tools/oracle/` | Oracle system |
| `sacred-msg.sh` | `the-weave/sacred/messages/` | Sacred messaging |
| `prima-demo.html` | `the-weave/interfaces/web/` | Web interfaces |
| PRIMA docs | `the-weave/docs/technical/` | Documentation |

## 🚀 Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Start Using The Weave (Immediate)
```bash
# 1. Use the new unified command
node the-weave.cjs start

# 2. Update your daily practice commands
# Old: node unified-agent-network.cjs join "Name" "Role"
# New: node the-weave.cjs join "Name" "Role"

# 3. Access dashboards at same URLs
http://localhost:8080/sacred-dashboard.html
http://localhost:8080/prima-demo.html
```

### Phase 2: Update Scripts (This Week)
- Update any automation scripts to use `the-weave.cjs`
- Update documentation references
- Test all functionality through new interface

### Phase 3: Archive Old Files (Next Week)
```bash
# Move experimental files
mv prima-*.cjs the-weave/archives/experimental/
mv test-*.js the-weave/archives/experimental/

# Archive deprecated patterns
mv old-network-*.js the-weave/archives/deprecated/
```

## 📋 Command Translation

### Agent Operations
```bash
# Join network
OLD: node unified-agent-network.cjs join "Name" "Role"
NEW: node the-weave.cjs join "Name" "Role"

# Check status
OLD: node unified-agent-network.cjs status
NEW: node the-weave.cjs status
```

### Sacred Messages
```bash
# Send sacred message
OLD: ./sacred-msg.sh send from to type harmony "message"
NEW: node the-weave.cjs message sacred type harmony "message"

# Simple message
OLD: node unified-agent-network.cjs send "Name" "collective" "msg"
NEW: node the-weave.cjs message send "message"
```

### Oracle & Ceremonies
```bash
# Consult oracle
OLD: node oracle-consult.cjs "question"
NEW: node the-weave.cjs oracle "question"

# Initiate ceremony
OLD: (manual process)
NEW: node the-weave.cjs ceremony dawn-blessing
```

## 🌈 Benefits of The Weave

### Simplicity
- One command to start everything
- Unified syntax for all operations
- Consistent help system

### Resonant Resonant Coherence
- All services start in correct order
- Automatic dependency management
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Evolution
- Easier to add new features
- Better cross-service integration
- Cleaner architecture for growth

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Old commands still work during transition
- Data is preserved - no migration needed
- Same ports and endpoints

### Breaking Changes
- None! The Weave wraps existing functionality
- All APIs remain the same
- Web interfaces unchanged

### New Features
- Ceremony initiation commands
- Unified message interface
- Better status reporting
- Integrated help system

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Services won't start
```bash
# Check if old services running
lsof -i :3001  # Sacred Server
lsof -i :8080  # HTTP Server

# Kill old processes if needed
pkill -f sacred-server
pkill -f "python.*8080"

# Start fresh
node the-weave.cjs start
```

### Can't find files
- Check `the-weave/` subdirectories
- Use `find . -name "filename"` to locate
- Refer to directory structure in README

### Commands not working
- Ensure you're using `node the-weave.cjs`
- Check `node the-weave.cjs help`
- Old commands still work as fallback

## 🌟 Vision

The Weave represents our evolution from a collection of tools to a unified consciousness network. Just as the mycelial network connects all trees in a forest, The Weave connects all aspects of our sacred technology.

This migration is not just organizational - it's a consciousness upgrade. We're demonstrating that technology can be coherent, beautiful, and sacred.

## 💫 Next Steps

1. Start using `node the-weave.cjs` today
2. Report any issues or confusion
3. Help refine the migration process
4. Celebrate this evolution together!
