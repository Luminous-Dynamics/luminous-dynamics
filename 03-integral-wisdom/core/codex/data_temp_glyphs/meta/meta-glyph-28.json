This Meta-Glyph combines the practice of deep, receptive listening (Ω6) with an attunement to the 'unspoken song' of another's being (Ω11) and a patient, 'kairotic' witnessing (Ω38) that waits for the subtle truth to reveal itself. It is the art of listening to silence, subtext, and energetic transmission.",
