This Meta-Glyph weaves together the act of honoring what is ending with sacred grief (Ω37), consciously recommitting to one's own forward-spiraling path (Ω39), and making a clean, decisive, and final severance of the energetic ties (inferred as Ω47). It is the architecture of a good death, a noble ending, and a graceful release.",
