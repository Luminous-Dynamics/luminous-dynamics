This Meta-Glyph combines deep receptive listening (Ω6) with the ability to perceive multiple layers of reality (Ω27) and the wisdom of 'kairotic' timing (Ω38). It is the practice of holding a person or situation in a profound, multi-layered, non-judgmental awareness, which itself helps the witnessed system find its own resonant-coherence.",
