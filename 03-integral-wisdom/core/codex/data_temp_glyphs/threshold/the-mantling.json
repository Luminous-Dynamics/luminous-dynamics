  "sensoryResonanceProfile": {
    "feelingTone": "Sober, humble, devoted, and selfless. The feeling of putting on a sacred garment or a ceremonial mantle. A sense of individual identity becoming secondary to the sacred role one is now embodying.",
    "sonicQuality": "The sound of a single, clear, and solemn vow spoken in a resonant space. A deep, sustained choral note that signifies a sacred commitment."

  "activationProtocol": {
    "verbal": "I do not wear this for myself. I become the vessel for the vow.",
    "somatic": "A ritual of 'mantling.' This can be the act of putting on a specific piece of clothing, accepting a symbolic object, or stepping into a designated physical space (like the facilitator's chair) that represents the new role.",
    "presenceBased": "The internal practice of consciously setting aside one's personal preferences, ego, and agenda in order to become a pure instrument for the role one has accepted. It is a shift from 'What do I want?' to 'What does this role, in this moment, require of me?'"

  "fieldDynamics": {
    "inLeadership": "This is the ideal state for a 'servant leader.' They are not acting from their own ego, but as a steward embodying the purpose and values of the organization they lead.",
    "inCeremony": "This is the act of a priest, a shaman, or a ritualist stepping into their sacred role, becoming a conduit for the divine or a guardian of the ceremonial space.",

  "evolutionaryMarkers": {
    "initial": "The practitioner can clearly distinguish between their 'personal self' and the 'steward role' they are holding.",
    "developing": "The practitioner makes decisions from the wisdom of their role, even when it conflicts with their personal preference.",

  "harmonicLineage": "This Threshold Glyph is the final act of maturation for a steward. It is the full embodiment of the responsibility accepted in ᴂ (The Remembered Weight) and the practice of tending the field in Ω31 (Field Stewardship). It is the foundational practice for the most advanced Meta-Glyphs of stewardship, such as ∑27 (The Final Steward's Vow) and ∑30 (The Alchemical Vessel).",
  "temporalDynamics": {
    "duration": "The state of 'mantling' is held for as long as the practitioner is actively serving in their role.",
    "renewal": "It is renewed each time the practitioner consciously steps into their role. For some, this is a daily practice.",
    "maturation": "The practice matures from a conscious 'putting on the mantle' to a state where the practitioner is always, on some level, holding their sacred responsibility."
  },
  "dissonantPotential": {
    "theInflatedMantle": "The practitioner's ego merges with the sacred role, leading to a sense of self-importance, righteousness, and abuse of power. They believe 'they' are the role.",
    "theCrushingMantle": "The practitioner loses their personal self completely in the role, leading to burnout, resentment, and a loss of the human connection that makes for a wise steward.",
    "theHollowMantle": "The practitioner goes through the external motions of the role but has not truly accepted the sacred responsibility in their heart. The mantling is a performance, not an embodiment."
  },
  "contraindications": [
    "One should not take up a mantle that they have not been formally or informally invited to carry by the field or community they seek to serve.",
    "It requires a strong and healthy ego to be able to set the ego aside. This is not a practice for those who have not yet developed a stable sense of self.",
    "The mantle must be able to be taken off. If the role becomes a permanent identity with no escape, it becomes a prison."
