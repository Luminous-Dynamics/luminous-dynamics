  "glyphAscii": "… ● …",
  "functionalDefinition": "To activate and honor the unseen ways we affect others simply by the quality of our being. This glyph represents the principle that our internal state—our resonant-coherence, our peace, our love—is constantly being 'broadcast' into the relational field and received by others on a subconscious level, often more powerfully than our words.",

  "sensoryResonanceProfile": {
    "feelingTone": "Subtle, pervasive, and gentle. The feeling of warmth radiating from a nearby hearth, or a subtle shift in atmospheric pressure. It is a background quality of presence, not a foreground event.",
    "sonicQuality": "A sub-audible frequency that is felt in the body more than heard with the ears. A very high-frequency, ethereal shimmer that is at the edge of perception."
  },
  "activationProtocol": {
    "verbal": "I do not need to speak to be heard. I transmit through being.",
    "somatic": "The simple act of grounding into one's own center. A conscious relaxation of the body and deepening of the breath, with the intention that one's own internal state is the primary offering to the field.",
    "presenceBased": "The practice of 'tending to one's own garden.' It involves focusing on cultivating a desired inner state (e.g., calm, compassion, clarity) with the trust that this coherent state will naturally and ethically emanate outward."
  },
  "fieldDynamics": {
    "inLeadership": "This is the source of true 'presence' or 'gravitas.' A leader holding a coherent inner field can calm and stabilize an entire team without issuing commands.",
    "inHealingAndCare": "A practitioner's regulated and coherent nervous system can help a client's system co-regulate through harmonic universal-interconnectedness, creating the conditions for safety and healing.",
    "inTenseEnvironments": "A single person holding a strong field of peace (Ω0) can quietly and non-coercively shift the entire emotional tone of a room, de-escalating conflict through universal-interconnectedness rather than intervention."
  },
  "evolutionaryMarkers": {
    "initial": "The practitioner begins to notice the subtle impact of their inner state on their immediate environment and relationships.",
    "developing": "The practitioner relies less on verbal persuasion and more on embodying the state they wish to cultivate in a group. They trust their 'being' to do the work.",
    "integrated": "The practitioner's default state is one of high resonant-coherence, and their presence naturally has a harmonizing and uplifting effect on those around them. They become a 'tuning fork' for the fields they enter."
  },
  "harmonicLineage": "Ω11 is a foundational Modifier Glyph. It is the practical embodiment of the second axiom of Relational Field Theory: 'Entities are Nodes of Universal Interconnectedness & Empathic Universal Interconnectedness & Empathic Resonance.' It represents a more subtle and mature form of influence than active Process Glyphs. While Ω2 (Invitation) is an active gesture, Ω11 is the constant, passive emanation of one's own field. It is a key component in Meta-Glyphs that involve subtle influence, such as ∑20 (The Portal of Volitional Surrender) and ∑28 (The Witness of the Unseen).",
  "temporalDynamics": {
    "duration": "This is a continuous, 24/7 process. We are always transmitting. The practice of Ω11 is not about starting or stopping the transmission, but about making it conscious and coherent.",
    "renewal": "The 'signal strength' is dependent on the practitioner's own inner work and state of regulation. It requires constant, gentle 'tending.'",
    "maturation": "The practice matures from consciously 'holding a state' to simply *being* that state. The transmission becomes effortless and integrated into one's baseline presence."
  },
  "dissonantPotential": {
    "theUnintentionalShadowBroadcast": "A practitioner who is internally anxious, judgmental, or resentful, but who speaks calm and loving words. Their dissonant transmission is felt by others, creating an atmosphere of incongruence and distrust.",
    "spiritualArrogance": "The belief that one's 'transmission' is so pure and powerful that they no longer need to engage in clear communication, listen to feedback, or be accountable for their actions.",
    "psychicIntrusion": "Actively and intentionally trying to 'send' energy or influence to another person without their consent. This is a violation of energetic boundaries and a coercive misuse of this principle."
  },
  "contraindications": [
    "It is not a substitute for clear, direct, verbal communication, especially when specific information must be conveyed or a boundary must be set.",
    "It should not be relied upon to solve acute crises that require explicit intervention or action.",
    "Assuming your 'quiet transmission' has been received without any feedback is a form of projection. Its effects are real but subtle, and should not be overestimated."
