  "functionalDefinition": "To activate the field of co-evolution, where a relationship itself becomes a crucible for mutual transformation. This glyph is the principle that beings grow not by 'fixing' each other, but by creating a resonant field in which each participant is continuously shaped and evolved through the interaction. It is the engine of a living, adaptive partnership.",

  "sensoryResonanceProfile": {
    "feelingTone": "Dynamic, synergistic, alive, and generative. The feeling of a dance where both partners are leading and following simultaneously. A sense of joyful, upward-spiraling momentum.",
    "sonicQuality": "Two distinct musical voices or instruments weaving in harmony, creating a third, richer overtone that was not present in either voice alone. A complex, evolving melody."

  "activationProtocol": {
    "verbal": "I do not complete you. I become with you.",
    "somatic": "A mirrored gesture performed with a partner, such as both tracing an infinity symbol (∞) in the air between you simultaneously. It can also be the simple act of walking in step together with shared awareness.",
    "presenceBased": "The conscious practice of holding the other person not as a static object, but as an unfolding process. It requires holding one's own perspective lightly and being genuinely willing to be changed by what the other offers."
  },
  "fieldDynamics": {
    "inNewRelationships": "This is the exciting, generative field of discovery, where two systems are learning from and adapting to each other at a rapid pace.",
    "inLongTermRelationships": "This is the essential practice that prevents stagnation. It allows the relationship to evolve and meet new challenges, rather than relying on old, static patterns.",
    "inCreativeCollaboration": "This is the 'jam session' field, where new ideas emerge from the synergistic interplay between collaborators that no single individual could have conceived of alone."
  },
  "evolutionaryMarkers": {
    "initial": "Participants begin using 'we' language naturally when describing their process or ideas.",
    "developing": "Participants can point to specific ways their own perspectives have genuinely changed as a direct result of the other's influence. Disagreements are often resolved not by compromise, but by the co-creation of a third, superior option.",
    "integrated": "The relationship itself begins to feel like a third intelligence in the room, with its own wisdom and perspective. The partners trust the 'wisdom of the we' as much as they trust their own."
  },
  "harmonicLineage": "Ω7 is a foundational Process Glyph. It represents the first major emergent outcome of the initial relational sequence (Ω0-Ω6). Once presence, invitation, trust, and listening are established, Ω7 is the glyph that puts that field into creative, evolutionary motion. It is the beginning of the 'dance' of co-creation and a core component of the Meta-Glyph for long-term partnership, ∑18 (The Covenant Spiral).",
  "temporalDynamics": {
    "duration": "This is an ongoing, dynamic process, not a momentary state. Its effects are cumulative and strengthen with sustained, conscious engagement.",
    "renewal": "It requires active participation from all parties. If one partner becomes static or unwilling to evolve, the field of mutual becoming collapses.",
    "maturation": "The process matures into a state where co-evolution becomes the effortless and joyful default mode of the relationship. Change and growth are no longer seen as threatening, but as the natural expression of the relationship's aliveness."
  },
  "dissonantPotential": {
    "theCoDependentMerge": "Participants lose their individual sovereignty and sense of self in the 'we,' mistaking fusion for connection. The growth of the relationship comes at the cost of the individuals.",
    "projectiveTransformation": "One partner uses the language of 'mutual becoming' as a guise for trying to 'fix' or change the other into their preferred image, violating their autonomy.",
    "competitiveBecoming": "The process devolves into a subtle competition over who is growing, learning, or evolving 'more' or 'better,' creating a hierarchy within the 'we.'"
  },
  "contraindications": [
    "This glyph should be approached with caution if strong individual boundaries (Ω10) and a clear sense of self have not yet been established by all participants.",
    "It is contraindicated in relationships with a significant power imbalance, as it can be easily co-opted by the more powerful party.",
    "It requires a shared, explicit commitment. Activating it unilaterally can lead to frustration and relational imbalance."
