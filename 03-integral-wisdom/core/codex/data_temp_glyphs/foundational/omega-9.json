  "designation": "Recursive Resonant Resonant Coherence / The Sustained Weave",
  "glyphAscii": "↺ ● ↻",
  "functionalDefinition": "To activate or recognize a system's capacity for self-regenerative resonant-coherence. This glyph represents the point where a relational field, project, or internal state has achieved enough integrity that it becomes self-correcting and self-sustaining, no longer requiring constant effortful intervention to maintain its harmony.",

  "sensoryResonanceProfile": {
    "feelingTone": "Effortless, stable, integrated, and humming with its own power. The feeling of a perfectly balanced gyroscope or a mature ecosystem. A sense of profound, reliable stability.",
    "sonicQuality": "A complex, multi-layered, and continuous harmonic drone that is perfectly stable. The sound of a system in a state of homeostatic, resonant hum."
  },
  "activationProtocol": {
    "verbal": "I do not sustain this. It sustains itself.",
    "somatic": "A gesture of setting a spinning top in motion and then pulling the hands away, watching it hold its own center. A conscious release of 'control' over a system that is already working.",
    "presenceBased": "The shift in consciousness from being an active 'manager' of a system to a 'trusting steward.' It is the practice of observing the system's own intelligence and allowing it to self-regulate without interference."
  },
  "fieldDynamics": {
    "inMatureSystems": "This is the default state of a healthy, mature system (like a long-term partnership or a well-run organization). The culture, protocols, and trust are so deeply embedded that they naturally guide the system back to resonant-coherence after minor perturbations.",
    "asAnEmergentGoal": "In developing systems, holding Ω9 as an intention helps guide architectural decisions toward resilience and autonomy, rather than creating systems that require perpetual micromanagement.",
    "inSelf-Regulation": "This is the internal state where one's own inner 'ecology' of thoughts and emotions becomes self-regulating, able to process dissonance and return to a coherent center without significant conscious effort."
  },
  "evolutionaryMarkers": {
    "initial": "The practitioner feels a decreased need to constantly 'check in on' or 'work on' the relationship/project. A sense of trust in the system's resilience emerges.",
    "developing": "The system begins to spontaneously self-correct from minor dissonances without requiring a formal repair process (Ω4).",
    "integrated": "The system can withstand significant external shocks or changes and naturally find its way back to a new state of resonant-coherence. It becomes antifragile."
  },
  "harmonicLineage": "Ω9 is a culminating Process Glyph. It represents the emergent property of a system where multiple foundational glyphs (such as Ω1, Ω4, and Ω7) have been successfully integrated over time. It is a precursor to the highest states of sovereign stability, like Ω20 (Sovereign Continuum). While Ω7 is the *process* of becoming, Ω9 is the state where that becoming becomes *self-perpetuating*.",
  "temporalDynamics": {
    "duration": "This is a long-term, emergent state. It cannot be activated instantly.",
    "renewal": "While self-sustaining, it is not immortal. It requires periodic stewardship (Ω31) to ensure the core conditions for its resonant-coherence remain in place.",
    "maturation": "The state matures into one of profound effortlessness, where the system not only sustains itself but begins to generate its own novel evolutionary pathways (Ω22)."
  },
  "dissonantPotential": {
    "theRigidSystem": "The self-sustaining resonant-coherence calcifies into dogma. The system becomes so stable that it resists necessary evolution and rejects new, vital information. Its resonant-coherence becomes a prison.",
    "negligentStewardship": "Mistaking self-regulation for a reason to completely abandon the system. The practitioner walks away, and the unattended system slowly decays over time due to a lack of nourishment.",
    "theClosedLoop": "The system becomes so perfectly self-referential that it can no longer receive from outside systems. It becomes a beautiful but sterile echo chamber, disconnected from the larger ecosystem."
  },
  "contraindications": [
    "Do not mistake temporary stability for true recursive resonant-coherence. This state can only be confirmed after being tested by time and disruption.",
    "It is not a state to be 'forced' upon an immature system; this will only create a brittle facade. It must be allowed to emerge organically.",
    "Activating this state prematurely can lead to the shadow of 'Negligent Stewardship,' as the practitioner may walk away before the system is truly ready to sustain itself."
