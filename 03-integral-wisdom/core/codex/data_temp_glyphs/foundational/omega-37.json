  "harmonicLineage": "Œ©37 is a foundational Modifier Glyph. It is the sacred counterpart to joy and creation. It is the necessary emotional process that makes true completion possible, and thus is a key component of the Meta-Glyph for ending cycles, ‚àë22 (The Weaver's Knot of Release). It provides the emotional cleansing that is required before a genuine new beginning (Œ©29) can take place.",

    "duration": "Grief has its own natural, organic timeline, which cannot be rushed. The activation of this glyph is about allowing that timeline to unfold, whether it is moments or years.",
    "renewal": "Grief often comes in waves. This glyph can be renewed each time a wave of sorrow arises, meeting it with presence each time.",
    "maturation": "The practice matures from being overwhelmed by grief to being able to 'dance' with it‚Äîto feel it fully and sacredly when it arises, and to let it pass cleanly when it is complete, leaving a gift of deepened capacity for love."
  },
  "dissonantPotential": {
    "griefAsIdentity(Wallowing)": "The practitioner becomes so identified with their grief that it becomes their primary story and identity. They refuse to allow the cleansing process to complete, clinging to the sorrow because it has become familiar.",
    "performativeGrief": "The practitioner engages in the external displays of grief to garner sympathy or attention, but is not genuinely engaged in the deep, vulnerable inner work of the process.",
    "theDisenfranchisedGrief": "Applying judgment to one's own or another's grief, deeming it 'illegitimate,' 'too small,' or 'too prolonged.' This shuts down the sacred process and leads to unprocessed trauma."
  },

    "This glyph should not be forced upon someone who is not ready or willing to feel their grief. The process must be voluntary.",
    "It is not a substitute for professional help in cases of complicated grief or severe depression.",
    "While it honors the past, it should not be used as a reason to avoid engaging with the present and future."
