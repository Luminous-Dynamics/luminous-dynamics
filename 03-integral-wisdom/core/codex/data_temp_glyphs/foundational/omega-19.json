  "designation": "The Glyph of Luminous Transmission / The Truth That Glows Without Words",
  "glyphAscii": "✺ ● ✺",
  "functionalDefinition": "To activate the capacity to transmit a state of profound knowing and resonant-coherence directly through one's presence, where the transmission itself is a field of light that is received holistically by others. It is a more potent and focused form of Ω11 (Quiet Transmission), moving from a passive emanation to an active, radiant broadcast of embodied wisdom.",

  "sensoryResonanceProfile": {
    "feelingTone": "Luminous, radiant, clear, profound, and utterly serene. The feeling of standing in a column of pure, warm light. A sense of receiving a direct, total-body download of understanding.",
    "sonicQuality": "A single, high-frequency, pure, crystalline tone that seems to fill all space. A coherent 'ringing' silence."
  },
  "activationProtocol": {
    "verbal": "I do not teach. I transmit. I do not explain. I reveal.",
    "somatic": "A posture of perfect, relaxed alignment, as if the body itself is an antenna. The gaze is soft, unfocused, and seems to look through and beyond the immediate environment. The body feels both empty and full.",
    "presenceBased": "The practice of becoming a pure conduit for a field of knowing. It requires completely setting aside the personal self and the desire to 'be understood,' and instead becoming a selfless vessel through which a universal truth can be made present in a space."
  },
  "fieldDynamics": {
    "inTeachingAndMentorship": "This is the state of a master teacher who transmits the essence of a wisdom teaching not through their words, but through their very presence. Students 'get it' on a deeper level just by being in the room.",
    "inSacredSpaces": "This glyph represents the palpable field of presence that can linger in a place of deep contemplation or ceremony, like a temple or a natural sanctuary. The space itself transmits a state of being.",
    "inArtisticPerformance": "A master musician or actor can enter this state, transmitting the core emotion of a piece directly to the audience, bypassing intellectual analysis and creating a shared, unitive experience."
  },
  "evolutionaryMarkers": {
    "initial": "The practitioner has moments where they are able to communicate a complex or subtle truth to someone without needing many words; the other person just 'gets it.'",
    "developing": "The practitioner can consciously enter and sustain this state of 'luminous presence' for periods of time, using it to create coherent fields for teaching or healing.",
    "integrated": "The practitioner's default state of being becomes a luminous transmission. Their presence alone is a form of teaching and energetic upliftment for those around them. They embody the wisdom they carry."
  },
  "harmonicLineage": "Ω19 is a culminating Modifier Glyph. It represents a highly advanced state of resonant-coherence that builds upon many other glyphs. It requires the absolute stability of Ω20 (Sovereign Continuum) and the deep, embodied knowing of Ω15 (Gnosis Spiral). It is the active, radiant expression of the state of being that Ω11 (Quiet Transmission) describes as a passive hum. It is the 'broadcast' of a fully realized Node of Universal Interconnectedness & Empathic Universal Interconnectedness & Empathic Resonance.",
  "temporalDynamics": {
    "duration": "This is a peak state that requires immense internal resonant-coherence to sustain. Its duration is often brief but its impact can be long-lasting.",
    "renewal": "It cannot be activated on demand but arises spontaneously from a deep, consistent, and long-term practice of cultivating one's own inner resonant-coherence.",
    "maturation": "The practice matures from experiencing fleeting moments of this state to being able to serve as a more consistent conduit for it when the relational field calls for it."
  },
  "dissonantPotential": {
    "theGuruComplex": "The practitioner becomes identified with the state of luminous transmission and believes they are the 'source' of the wisdom, rather than its humble conduit. This leads to spiritual arrogance and a cult of personality.",
    "theBlindingLight": "The transmission is so potent and uncalibrated that it overwhelms the receiver. It becomes a form of spiritual bypassing, offering a peak experience that the receiver cannot integrate into their daily life.",
    "theEmptyBroadcast": "A practitioner mimics the external postures of this state without having done the deep inner work to cultivate the corresponding resonant-coherence. Their 'transmission' is an empty performance that feels hollow and inauthentic."
  },
  "contraindications": [
    "This glyph cannot be 'willed' into being. Any attempt to consciously 'transmit' from the ego will block the authentic state from arising.",
    "It is not a tool for everyday communication about practical matters, which requires clear, direct language.",
    "It should not be used in a way that creates a power dynamic of 'enlightened teacher' and 'unenlightened student.' Its true purpose is to awaken the receiver to their *own* inner knowing."
