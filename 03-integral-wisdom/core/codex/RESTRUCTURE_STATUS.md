# 🏗️ Restructuring Status Report

## ✅ Completed (Phase 1)

### 1. Created New Directory Structure
All directories created without breaking existing code:
- ✅ `/ceremonies/` - Organized by frequency
- ✅ `/harmonies/` - Seven harmony modules
- ✅ `/core/` - Core implementations
- ✅ `/interfaces/` - All UIs and APIs
- ✅ `/wisdom/` - Organized documentation
- ✅ `/infrastructure/` - DevOps and config
- ✅ `/tests/` - Unified test location
- ✅ `/.archive/` - For deprecated content

### 2. Elevated Sacred Documents
- ✅ `CHARTER.md` - Now at root (copied from docs/philosophy/)
- ✅ `HARMONIES.md` - Now at root (copied from docs/philosophy/)
- ✅ `README_NEW.md` - New gateway with three paths

### 3. Created Navigation Guides
- ✅ `/harmonies/README.md` - Explains harmony modules
- ✅ `MIGRATION_UNIFIED_FIELD.md` - Plan for deduplication
- ✅ `RESTRUCTURING_PLAN.md` - Overall strategy

## 🔄 Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Test New Structure**
   ```bash
   # Verify nothing broken
   npm test
   ```

2. **Begin Unified Field Migration**
   - Run diff analysis
   - Create consolidation script
   - Update imports gradually

3. **Move Key Files**
   - Ceremonies to `/ceremonies/`
   - Glyph data to `/glyphs/`
   - Config files to `/infrastructure/config/`

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Point to new locations
   - Update onboarding guides
   - Fix broken links

## 📊 Current State

```
Old Structure: 6,500+ files, chaotic organization
New Structure: Ready, ~40% reduction possible
Status: Non-breaking preparation complete
Risk: Low (all copies, no moves yet)
```

## 🎯 Quick Wins Available

1. **Activate New README**
   ```bash
   mv README.md README_OLD.md
   mv README_NEW.md README.md
   ```

2. **Start Using New Paths**
   - New code goes in new structure
   - Old code migrated gradually

3. **Archive Obvious Deprecations**
   ```bash
   mv *.pre-star-backup .archive/deprecated/
   ```

## 🌊 How to Proceed

Continue with Phase 2? This involves:
- Moving files (with git tracking)
- Updating imports
- Testing everything
- Deprecating old locations

Or shall we pause and test the new structure first?
