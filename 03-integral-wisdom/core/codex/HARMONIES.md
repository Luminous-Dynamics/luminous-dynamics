## ❌ INCORRECT Simplified Versions to Replace:
- ~~Transparency~~ → Use Integral Wisdom Cultivation
- ~~Coherence~~ → Use Resonant Coherence (fuller meaning)
- ~~Resonance~~ → Part of Universal Interconnectedness
- ~~Agency~~ → Part of Evolutionary Progression
- ~~Vitality~~ → Part of Pan-Sentient Flourishing
- ~~Mutuality~~ → Use Sacred Reciprocity
- ~~Novelty~~ → Use Infinite Play & Creative Emergence

## 📝 Implementation Notes:
1. Update ALL glyph mappings to use correct Harmonies
2. Revise documentation to reflect fuller meanings
3. Ensure new content uses official formulations
4. The 87 glyphs should map to these Seven PRIMARY Harmonies

## 💡 Remember:
These are not just categories but "overtones of a singular note" - the Meta-Principle of Infinite Love as Rigorous, Playful, Co-Creative Becoming.

"Make it better!" 🌟
