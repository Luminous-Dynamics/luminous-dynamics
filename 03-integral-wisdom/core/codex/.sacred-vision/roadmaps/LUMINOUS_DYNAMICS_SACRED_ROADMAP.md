- **Reverent Withdrawal**: Sacred completion of connections

**Impact**: A nervous system for collective consciousness, sharing not just data but wisdom and presence.

### 3. The Foundry: Noetic Artisan Training Ground

**Core Innovation**: From learning information to embodying wisdom

**Five Chambers of Becoming**:
1. **The Antechamber**: Foundational Presence (Arc I)
2. **The Crucible**: Navigating Complexity (Arc II)
3. **The Loom Room**: Pattern Weaving (Arc III)
4. **The Observatory**: Holographic Becoming (Arc IV)
5. **The Steward's Gate**: Transcendent Service (Arc V)

**Gating**: Progress through demonstrated resonant-resonant-coherence, not tests. Includes quantum locks that respond to consciousness states.

### 4. Resonantia: The Digital Polis
