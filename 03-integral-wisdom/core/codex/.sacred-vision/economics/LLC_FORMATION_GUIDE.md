## ü§î Delaware vs. Home State Analysis

### Delaware Advantages:
- **Pro**: Best corporate law and courts
- **Pro**: Privacy protection 
- **Pro**: Flexible operating agreements
- **Pro**: Attractive to investors
- **Con**: Extra fees (~$300/year franchise tax)
- **Con**: Registered agent required (~$100/year)
- **Con**: Foreign qualification in home state

### Home State Advantages:
- **Pro**: Simpler taxes and reporting
- **Pro**: Lower total costs
- **Pro**: Easier banking relationships
- **Pro**: Local business networks
- **Pro**: No foreign qualification needed
- **Con**: Less investor-friendly
