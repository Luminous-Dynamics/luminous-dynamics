- Test the relationship
- Learn what works
- Build trust
- Commit when ready

Your energy is better spent on:
- Creating transformation
- Serving practitioners
- Building community
- Living the practice

Than on:

- Fear of starting

## ✨ Remember

Every sacred business started somewhere. Apple started in a garage. Facebook in a dorm room. Relational Harmonics starts in your heart.

The structure serves the sacred, not vice versa.

**Start now. Evolve consciously. Serve love.**
