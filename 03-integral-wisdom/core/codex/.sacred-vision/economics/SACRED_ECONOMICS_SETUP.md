# 💰 Sacred Economics Setup Guide
## Consciousness-Based Payment System

### Philosophy: Value Flows from Transformation, Not Extraction

Our payment system is revolutionary:
- **Same access for all tiers** - No premium features
- **Sliding scale by choice** - Pay what feels aligned
- **Scholarships always available** - Money never blocks access
- **Sacred supporters welcome** - Some pay more to support others
- **Trust-based system** - We trust practitioners' choices

        description: "I need full support right now",
        message: "Welcome! Your presence is the gift."
    },
    
    supported: {
        factor: 0.5,
        description: "I can contribute half",
        message: "Thank you for what you can share."
    },
    
    standard: {
        factor: 1.0,
        description: "I can pay full price",
        message: "Your support sustains the work."
    },
    
    supporter: {
        factor: 1.5,
        description: "I can support another",
        message: "Your generosity creates access!"
    },
    
    guardian: {
        factor: 2.0,
        description: "I guardian this work",

    }
};
```

## 🌟 Checkout Flow

    <div class="tier-selector">
        <!-- Tier options -->
    </div>
    
    <div class="sliding-scale">
        <h3>Adjust for Your Situation</h3>
        <!-- Sliding scale options -->
    </div>
    
    <button onclick="createCheckout()">Begin Sacred Exchange</button>
    
    <div class="scholarship-option">
        <a href="#" onclick="applyForScholarship()">

</div>
```

### 2. JavaScript Integration
```javascript
async function createCheckout() {
    const tier = document.querySelector('input[name="tier"]:checked').value;
    const scale = document.querySelector('input[name="scale"]:checked').value;
    
    const response = await fetch('/api/create-checkout', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            userId: currentUser.uid,
            tier: tier,
            slidingScale: parseFloat(scale)
        })
    });
    
    const { checkoutUrl } = await response.json();
    window.location.href = checkoutUrl;
}

async function applyForScholarship() {
    // Simple form for scholarship
    const application = {
        situation: "Brief description of situation",
        contribution: "How I'll contribute non-monetarily",
        intention: "My intention with this work"
    };
    
    // Auto-approved for now
    const result = await submitScholarship(application);
    showMessage("Welcome! Your scholarship is approved. 🙏");
}
```

## 📊 Sacred Value Tracking

Beyond money, we track:
- Practice hours contributed
- Stories shared
- Others supported
- Ceremonies attended
- Resonant Resonant Coherence contribution
- Field amplification

```javascript
// Monthly sacred value report
const valueReport = {
    monetary: "$77 subscription",
    nonMonetary: {
        practiceHours: 12.5,
        storiesShared: 3,
        buddiesSupported: 2,
        ceremoniesAttended: 4
    },
    sacredImpact: {
        coherenceBoost: "+5% field average",
        breakthroughsSupported: 2,
        loveMultiplier: 1.7
    },
    totalValue: "Infinite ✨"
};
```

## 🎁 Gift Memberships

```javascript
async function giftMembership() {
    const gift = {
        recipientEmail: "friend@example.com",
        tier: "bloom",
        message: "May this support your sacred journey"
    };
    
    const checkout = await createGiftCheckout(gift);
    // Redirect to payment
}

// Recipient receives:
// - Beautiful gift email
// - Unique gift code
// - Welcome to sacred space
// - No payment required
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **PCI Compliance**: Stripe handles all card data
2. **Webhook Security**: Verify signatures always
3. **User Privacy**: Minimal data collection
4. **Subscription Management**: Users control everything
5. **Refund Policy**: 30-day loving refund
