### Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project:

1. **Never commit secrets**: API keys, passwords, tokens
2. **Use environment variables**: For all sensitive configuration
3. **Review dependencies**: Check for known vulnerabilities
4. **Validate inputs**: Prevent injection attacks
5. **Follow principle of least privilege**: Minimal permissions needed

### Sacred Security Principles

In alignment with our consciousness-first approach:

- **Integral Wisdom Cultivation**: Clear about what data we collect and why
- **Consent**: Always request permission before accessing
