üßµ THREAD: Most AI optimizes for addiction. We're building the opposite.

1/6 Problem: Every AI system today maximizes time-on-platform
‚Üí Infinite scroll, intermittent rewards, FOMO triggers  
‚Üí Users feel scattered, anxious, less focused

2/6 What if AI helped you stay focused instead of getting distracted?
‚Üí Built-in focus breaks that can't be skipped
‚Üí Natural conversation pacing  
‚Üí Sessions end when YOU'RE ready, not when algorithms want more

3/6 We've designed the first AI with "intentional friction"
‚Üí 3-second pauses before responses (prevents doom scrolling)
‚Üí Session limits that protect your attention
‚Üí Success measured by satisfaction, not engagement time

4/6 Technical approach:
‚Üí React/TypeScript with focus-first state management
‚Üí Node.js backend with ethical prompt engineering
‚Üí Privacy-first analytics (no tracking, no manipulation)

5/6 Looking for 3-5 developers who've experienced tech burnout
‚Üí You know the problem because you've lived it
‚Üí Ready to build technology that serves users
‚Üí Technical skills + ethical motivation

6/6 This isn't just another startup. It's fixing how AI relates to human attention.

Subject: Building AI that doesn't hijack attention - interested?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: Have you ever felt like the apps you build are designed to be addictive rather than helpful?

I'm reaching out because of your background in [specific area]. We're assembling a small team (3-5 developers) to build the first AI system designed to protect user attention instead of hijacking it.

The problem: Every AI today optimizes for engagement = addiction = scattered minds
Our solution: AI with built-in focus breaks, natural pacing, user-first design

We've completed the technical specifications and are ready to build:
- React/TypeScript frontend with attention-preserving UX
- Node.js backend with ethical AI principles
- Privacy-first design with no manipulation tactics

This isn't traditional hiring - it's forming a founding team with shared equity and decision-making. Looking for developers who've experienced tech burnout personally and want to build the alternative.

Interested in learning more?

```
Title: Building AI with "intentional friction" to prevent doom scrolling

We're prototyping what might be the first AI system explicitly designed to protect user attention rather than hijack it.

Technical approach:
- 3-second mandatory pauses between responses (prevents rapid-fire addiction patterns)
- Natural conversation pacing that respects human processing speed
- Session limits based on user wellbeing rather than engagement metrics
- Success measured by user satisfaction, not time-on-platform

The ML challenge: How do you optimize for user wellbeing when current metrics reward addiction?

Our solution:
- Multi-objective optimization weighing engagement vs. user reported satisfaction
- Attention-preserving prompt engineering 
- Privacy-first analytics that measure focus improvement, not engagement

Early results suggest users feel less scattered and more focused after sessions.

Looking for ML researchers interested in ethical AI alignment and attention economy problems.

```
Title: Recruiting developers to build AI that doesn't hijack your attention

Honest question: Are you tired of building products designed to be addictive?

We're forming a small team to build the alternative - AI that helps users stay focused instead of getting distracted.

The concept:
- Built-in focus breaks that can't be skipped
- Conversations that end naturally, not infinitely
- No dark patterns, no manipulation, no attention hijacking
- Open source ethical AI principles

Technical stack:
- React/TypeScript frontend with focus-first state management
- Node.js backend with ethical prompt engineering
- Privacy-first analytics (we don't track, we don't manipulate)

We're not looking for just any developers. We want people who:
- Have experienced tech burnout personally
- Understand the attention economy problems from the inside
- Want to build technology that actually serves users

This is founding team formation, not traditional hiring. Shared equity, collaborative decision-making, mission-driven work.

Title: Show HN: First AI designed to prevent doom scrolling instead of causing it

We've built a prototype AI system with "intentional friction" - 3-second pauses before responses, natural session endings, and focus-preserving interaction patterns.

The problem: Every AI today optimizes for engagement, which equals addiction, which equals scattered minds.

Our approach:
- Built-in delays that prevent rapid-fire scrolling patterns
- Conversations designed to conclude naturally
- Success metrics based on user satisfaction, not time-on-platform
- Privacy-first design with no tracking or manipulation

Technical implementation:
- React/TypeScript frontend with attention-preserving state management
- Node.js backend with ethical prompt engineering
- Multi-objective ML optimization balancing engagement vs. user wellbeing

Early testing shows users report feeling more focused and less scattered after sessions.

We're forming a small founding team of developers who've experienced tech burnout and want to build the alternative.

üîß Building AI that reduces screen addiction instead of causing it

After years in tech, I've seen too many talented developers burn out building products designed to be addictive rather than helpful.

We're forming a small founding team to build the alternative: AI that protects user attention instead of hijacking it.

The innovation:
‚Üí Built-in focus breaks that can't be skipped
‚Üí Natural conversation pacing that respects human processing
‚Üí Session limits based on user wellbeing, not engagement metrics
‚Üí Privacy-first design with no manipulation tactics

Technical foundation:
- React/TypeScript + Node.js architecture
- Ethical AI prompt engineering
- Multi-objective optimization for user satisfaction vs. engagement
- Open source principles and transparent development

Looking for 3-5 developers who:
- Have experienced tech burnout personally
- Want to build technology that serves users instead of algorithms
- Are ready for founding team equity and collaborative decision-making

This isn't about adding meditation features to existing apps. It's about fundamentally redesigning how AI relates to human attention.

- Clear technical stack (React/TypeScript, Node.js)
- Measurable outcomes (user satisfaction metrics)

### **4. Better Targeting**
- "Developers who've experienced tech burnout"
- "People who understand attention economy problems"
- "Founding team formation" not "hiring"

### **5. Stronger Social Proof**
- Appeals to shared experience (tech burnout)
- Positions as part of existing movements (digital wellness, ethical AI)
