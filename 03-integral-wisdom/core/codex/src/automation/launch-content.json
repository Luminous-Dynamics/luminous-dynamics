Looking for feedback from the ML community on conscious technology design."

      "body": "As a long-time practitioner, I've been bothered by how addictive most AI interfaces are. So we built the opposite.\n\nThis AI companion:\n- Starts every session with breath awareness\n- Includes mandatory contemplative pauses (you literally can't skip them)\n- Has three different \"personas\" based on wisdom traditions\n- Regularly checks in with your embodied experience\n\nIt's not trying to keep you online forever. It's trying to support your awakening.\n\nDemo: https://luminousdynamics.org/demo\n\nWould love the meditation community's feedback. Does this feel authentic to you?"

We're building the opposite.\n\nOur AI companion is designed to:\n- Serve user wellbeing over engagement metrics\n- Include contemplative pauses that slow down interaction\n- Point users back to their own wisdom instead of creating dependency\n- End sessions naturally instead of extending them infinitely\n\nThis creates a completely different business model based on user flourishing rather than addiction.\n\nLive demo: https://luminousdynamics.org/demo\n\nWe're recruiting conscious developers who want to build technology that serves human consciousness.

Instead of optimizing for engagement time, we optimized for user wellbeing.\n\nLive demo: https://luminousdynamics.org/demo\nTechnical details: https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/codex-of-relational-harmonics\n\nThe technical approach uses what we call \"Resonant Interface Protocol\" - basically injecting contemplative timing into the conversation flow.\n\nWould be curious to get your thoughts on conscious AI design from a research perspective.\n\nBest,\nTristan & the Luminous Dynamics Team"

      "body": "Hi [Name],\n\nAs someone who teaches contemplative practice, I'd love your perspective on something we've built.\n\nWe created an AI companion that includes mandatory meditation pauses before every response. The idea is to slow down the interaction and support presence rather than reactivity.\n\nDemo: https://luminousdynamics.org/demo\n\nDoes this feel authentic to you as a practitioner? Or does it risk commodifying contemplative practice?\n\nYour wisdom would be invaluable as we navigate this intersection of technology and spirituality.\n\nWith respect,\nTristan & the Luminous Dynamics Team"
