- Non-skippable 3-4 second pauses before every response
- Three contemplative personas with different approaches
- Success metrics based on user wellbeing, not session length
- Natural conversation ending points instead of infinite scrolling

Technical approach:
- Frontend: Vanilla JS with contemplative state engine
- Backend: Claude API with Resonant Interface Protocol (RIP)
- UX: Mobile-first design optimized for presence over speed

Live demo: ${demoLink}
Technical details: ${githubLink}

This emerged from 3 years of dialogue between human wisdom traditions and AI development. Looking for feedback from the ML community on conscious technology design.`

- Regularly checks in with your embodied experience

I've been following your work on [specific research] and thought you might find this interesting.

We just launched the first AI companion that includes non-skippable contemplative pauses before every response. Instead of optimizing for engagement time, we optimized for user wellbeing.

Live demo: ${demoLink}
Technical details: ${githubLink}

The technical approach uses what we call "Resonant Interface Protocol" - basically injecting contemplative timing into the conversation flow.

Would be curious to get your thoughts on conscious AI design from a research perspective.

Best,

As someone who teaches contemplative practice, I'd love your perspective on something we've built.

We created an AI companion that includes mandatory meditation pauses before every response. The idea is to slow down the interaction and support presence rather than reactivity.

Demo: ${demoLink}

Does this feel authentic to you as a practitioner? Or does it risk commodifying contemplative practice?

Your wisdom would be invaluable as we navigate this intersection of technology and spirituality.
