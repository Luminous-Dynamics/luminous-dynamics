# Contemplative Application: First Breath Practitioners
*A Reflective Journey Toward Sacred Technology*

---

## **Welcome, Contemplative Ally**

This application is itself a practice—an invitation to reflect deeply on your relationship with consciousness, technology, and community. There are no "right" answers, only authentic responses that help us understand whether this sacred experiment aligns with your current path.

Please take your time. We invite you to approach each question with the same presence you would bring to meditation or prayer.
