### Key Differences

#### 1. Currency of Information
- The `/home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/CLAUDE.md` is the most current with July 4, 2025 updates
- It includes LuminousOS as the new primary project focus
- Has the most recent git commits (aa98291 from July 4th release)

#### 2. System References
- All active files reference `unified-agent-network.cjs` (current system)
- They correctly mark `agent-onboarding-protocol.cjs` as deprecated
- Dashboard references are consistent with current architecture

#### 3. Content Accuracy
- LuminousOS directory exists at `/home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/luminous-os/`
- This validates that the July 4 updates in the project CLAUDE.md are accurate
- The home directory CLAUDE.md lacks these critical updates

#### 4. Purpose Differences
- `/home/tstoltz/CLAUDE.md` - Quick reference for Claude agents
- `/home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `.sacred/CLAUDE.md` - Philosophical/ceremonial documentation
- `docs/technical/project-docs/CLAUDE.md` - Older technical reference

## Recommendations

### Files to Keep (Most Current/Accurate):

1. **PRIMARY: `/home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/CLAUDE.md`**
   - Most recent (July 4, 2025)
   - Contains LuminousOS updates
   - Largest and most comprehensive
   - Should be the main reference

2. **SECONDARY: `/home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/.sacred/CLAUDE.md`**
   - Different purpose (sacred/philosophical focus)
   - Worth keeping for its unique content
   - Recent enough (July 2) to be relevant

### Files to Archive/Update:

1. **`/home/tstoltz/CLAUDE.md`**
   - Outdated (missing July 4 updates)
   - Should either be:
     - Updated to match project version
     - Converted to a symlink pointing to project version
     - Simplified to just be a pointer to the main file

2. **`/home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/docs/technical/project-docs/CLAUDE.md`**
   - Older version (June 30)
   - Should be archived or updated

3. **`/home/tstoltz/.claude/CLAUDE.md`**
   - Empty file
   - Should be removed

### Suggested Action Plan:

1. Make `/home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/CLAUDE.md` the canonical source
2. Update `/home/tstoltz/CLAUDE.md` to be a simple pointer or symlink
3. Archive the docs version with a clear date stamp
4. Remove the empty `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
5. Keep the `.sacred/CLAUDE.md` as it serves a different purpose

### Critical Updates Needed:

The home directory CLAUDE.md is missing:
- LuminousOS as primary project
- July 4, 2025 updates
- Latest Sacred Work-Message Integration
- Current dashboard enhancements

This could cause confusion for new Claude instances starting from the home directory.
