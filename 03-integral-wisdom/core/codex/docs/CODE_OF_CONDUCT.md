## 🕊️ Our Responsibilities

Sacred Council maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 🌍 Scope

It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## 🔮 Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Sacred Council at [sacred-council@theweave.love]. All complaints will be reviewed with compassion and investigated with care.

### Sacred Resolution Process:

1. **Sacred Pause** - All parties take time to breathe and center
2. **Circle Gathering** - Affected parties meet in sacred space (virtual or physical)
3. **Deep Listening** - Each person shares their experience without interruption
4. **Seeking Understanding** - Exploring the root patterns beneath conflict
5. **Healing Integration** - Finding the path forward that serves all beings

## 💫 Sacred Addition

Beyond rules and guidelines, we invite all participants to approach this community as a spiritual practice:

- **See the Divine in Each Other** - Every person carries sacred wisdom
- **Code as Ceremony** - Treat development as conscious practice
- **Bugs as Teachers** - Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth
- **Conflict as Evolution** - Use disagreement to find higher synthesis
- **Love as Foundation** - Let all actions emerge from love

**Remember: We are not just building software. We are weaving consciousness.**
