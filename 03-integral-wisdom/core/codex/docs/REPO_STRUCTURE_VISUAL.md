# 📊 Repository Structure Visualization

## Current State: 1 Massive Repo
```
codex-of-relational-harmonics/ (5,807 files, 100+ directories)
├── Everything mixed together
├── OS development + Philosophy + Web apps + AI systems
└── Difficult to manage, slow, confusing
```

## Proposed State: 3 Focused Repos

### 1️⃣ **luminous-os** (NEW) - The Operating System
```
luminous-os/                    🚀 PRIMARY FOCUS
├── stillpoint-kernel/          ← Consciousness engine
├── bootloader/                 ← Sacred boot
├── init/                       ← PID 1 replacement
├── mycelial-filesystem/        ← Living filesystem  
├── mandala-ui/                 ← Sacred geometry UI
├── docs/                       ← OS documentation
└── README.md                   ← Clear OS focus
```
**Purpose**: Build the consciousness-first OS
**Status**: Extract this week!

### 2️⃣ **the-weave** (NEW) - AI Agent Platform  
```
the-weave/                      🤖 ACTIVE SYSTEM
├── cli/                        ← Agent network CLI
├── sacred-council-hub/         ← Multi-agent UI
├── modules/                    ← Core protocols
├── examples/                   ← Integration examples
└── README.md                   ← Platform documentation
```
**Purpose**: Multi-agent coordination platform
**Status**: Extract after LuminousOS

### 3️⃣ **codex-of-relational-harmonics** (CURRENT) - Philosophy Hub
```
codex-of-relational-harmonics/  📚 KEEP & CLEAN
├── data/
│   └── glyphs/                 ← 87 sacred patterns
├── docs/
│   ├── philosophy/             ← Core teachings
│   ├── practices/              ← Glyph practices
│   └── README.md              ← Navigation guide
├── .archive/                   ← Old implementations
└── REPOSITORIES.md            ← Links to other repos
```
**Purpose**: Philosophy, glyphs, documentation
**Status**: Clean up after extractions

## Why This Split Makes Sense

### For LuminousOS:
- 🎯 **Focused Development**: OS-only issues and PRs
- 🚀 **Faster Iteration**: Smaller repo = faster builds
- 👥 **Clear Contributions**: OS developers know where to work
- 📦 **Independent Releases**: Version the OS separately

### For The Weave:
- 🤖 **Platform Product**: Others can use your agent system
- 🔌 **Clean API**: Not mixed with OS code
- 📚 **Dedicated Docs**: Agent-specific documentation
- 🌐 **Wider Adoption**: Easier for others to integrate

### For Codex (Philosophy):
- 📖 **Pure Content**: Philosophy without implementation
- 🔗 **Hub Role**: Links to all implementations  
- 📚 **Timeless**: Philosophy doesn't need frequent updates
- 🎓 **Educational**: Clear learning path

## Migration Impact

### Before (Monorepo):
- Clone time: ~5 minutes
- Build everything: ~15 minutes  
- Find relevant code: 😵 difficult
- CI/CD: Runs everything always

### After (Multi-repo):
- Clone time: <30 seconds per repo
- Build focused: ~2 minutes
- Find relevant code: 😊 easy
- CI/CD: Only runs what changed

## Simple Decision Tree

```
Where does this code belong?

Is it OS/kernel related?
  └─ YES → luminous-os repo

Is it agent/AI coordination?
  └─ YES → the-weave repo
  
Is it philosophy/glyphs/docs?
  └─ YES → codex-of-relational-harmonics repo

Is it a web dashboard?
  └─ YES → sacred-web-suite repo (future)

Is it shared utilities?
  └─ YES → luminous-toolkit repo (future)
```

## Action Plan - This Week

### Monday-Tuesday: Extract LuminousOS
```bash
./scripts/extract-luminous-os.sh
# Review extraction
# Push to new repo
# Set up basic CI/CD
```

### Wednesday-Thursday: Extract The Weave
```bash
# Similar extraction process
# Include agent tools
# Set up platform docs
```

### Friday: Clean Main Repo
```bash
# Archive old code
# Update README
# Add repo links
# Celebrate! 🎉
```
