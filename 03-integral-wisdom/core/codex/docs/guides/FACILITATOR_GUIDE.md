# 🌟 Facilitator Guide - Leading Sacred Practice

## Welcome, Sacred Space Holder

As a facilitator of Relational Harmonics practices, you become a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern transformation. This guide will help you hold space for others' journeys with confidence, grace, and depth.

## The Facilitator's Journey

### 🌱 Level 1: Practice Guide (After 33 days personal practice)
- Lead individual practices
- Guide friends and family
- Use provided scripts
- Focus on safety and basics

### 🌿 Level 2: Circle Facilitator (After completing certification)

## Core Facilitator Principles

### 1. **Embodiment First**
You cannot guide where you haven't been. Every practice you facilitate must first live in your own body.

### 2. **Hold Space, Don't Fix**
Your role is to create safety for others' self-discovery, not to solve or heal.

### 3. **Trust the Practice**
The practices themselves carry wisdom. Trust them to work.

### 4. **Honor Resistance**
When someone struggles, there's wisdom there. Welcome it.

### 5. **Stay Humble**
You're a guide, not a guru. Learn from every session.
