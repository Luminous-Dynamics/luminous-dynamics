# ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - Clean Structure Established

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Clean Directory Structure ✓
```
production/
├── config/     # Production configurations
├── data/       # Production databases
└── services/   # Production services

development/
├── experiments/  # Experimental code
└── tests/       # Test files

legacy/
└── archived-2025-01/  # Old code to be cleaned
```

### 2. Database Consolidation ✓
- Central location: `/the-weave/core/data/`
- Active databases copied to central location
- Legacy databases identified for archival

### 3. Master Control Script ✓
```bash
./sacred-system.sh status   # Check everything
./sacred-system.sh start    # Start local dev
./sacred-system.sh stop     # Stop services
./sacred-system.sh deploy   # Deploy to cloud
./sacred-system.sh logs     # View logs
./sacred-system.sh clean    # Clean test data
```

## Current System Status

✅ **Local Services Running:**
- Ollama API (port 11434)
- Web Dashboard (port 8338)
- Agent Network (1 active agent, 83.5% resonant-coherence)

✅ **Cloud Services Active:**
- sacred-council-api
- sacred-council
- infin-love

## Ready for Phase 2

We now have:
1. Clear structure for organizing code
2. Single control point for all operations
3. Visibility into what's actually running

Next: Phase 2 - Consolidation
- Move services to production/
- Archive legacy code
- Update documentation
