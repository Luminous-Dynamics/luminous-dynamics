## 🎯 Strategic Domain Approach:

### Option 1: Don't Need Matching Domain
Since Luminous Dynamics is the **legal entity** (not public brand), you actually don't need the domain! 

Your structure:
- Legal: Luminous Dynamics, LLC *(no public website needed)*
- Brand: relationalharmonics.com *(your actual website)*
- Philosophy: ERC *(embedded within RH)*

### Option 2: Simple Corporate Page
Get any available variation like:
- luminousdynamics.co
- luminous-dynamics.net
- ld-holdings.com

Just for basic corporate info:
- "Parent company of Relational Harmonics"
- Legal notices
- Contact info

### Option 3: Alternative Legal Names
If domain matters to you, consider:

**Legal Name Variations:**
- Luminous Dynamics Labs, LLC
- Luminous Dynamic Systems, LLC  
- Lumina Dynamics, LLC
- Luminosity Dynamics, LLC
- Sacred Luminous, LLC
- Luminous Bridge, LLC

Then match domain to chosen name.

## 💡 My Recommendation:

**Don't worry about the Luminous Dynamics domain!**

Since it's just your legal entity:
1. Form as "Luminous Dynamics, LLC" anyway
2. Don't create a website for it
3. All public presence through relationalharmonics.com
4. Keep the beautiful trinity structure

OR if you want a domain:
- Grab **luminousdynamics.co** or **.io**
- Simple one-page site: "Luminous Dynamics is the parent company of Relational Harmonics"
- Link to relationalharmonics.com

The domain doesn't matter for:
- LLC formation ✓
- Bank accounts ✓
- Stripe setup ✓
- Legal operation ✓

What matters:
- relationalharmonics.com (your brand) ✓
- Beautiful legal structure ✓
- Getting started NOW ✓

Should we proceed with Luminous Dynamics, LLC regardless of domain?
