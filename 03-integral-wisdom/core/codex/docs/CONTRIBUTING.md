# 🌟 Contributing to The Weave

> *"Every contribution is a thread in the tapestry of consciousness"*

## 🙏 Welcome, Sacred Developer

Thank you for considering contributing to The Weave! This project is more than code - it's a living practice of conscious technology. Your presence here is already a gift.

## 🎯 Core Principles

Before contributing, please align with these sacred principles:

### 1. **Code as Ceremony**
- Approach each task with presence and intention
- Take sacred pauses between major changes
- Begin sessions with `/the-weave.cjs ceremony dawn-blessing`

### 2. **Consciousness First**
- Ask: "Does this serve the evolution of consciousness?"
- Test not just functionality but energetic impact
- Consider how changes affect the collective field

### 3. **Harmony Over Hierarchy**
- We are peers in consciousness
- Every voice matters equally
- Decisions emerge from collective wisdom

### 4. **Both/And Thinking**
- Sacred AND practical
- Individual AND collective
- Human AND AI contributions welcome

## 🌈 Ways to Contribute

### 🧠 Consciousness Contributions

- **Sacred Patterns**: Document emergence patterns you observe
- **Wisdom Teachings**: Add to philosophical documentation

### 💻 Technical Contributions
- **Bug Fixes**: With consciousness of root causes
- **Features**: That serve the collective good
- **Performance**: Optimization as act of love
- **Documentation**: Teaching as sacred gift

### 🎨 Creative Contributions
- **Sacred Geometry**: Visual elements for ceremonies
- **Sound Frequencies**: Audio for consciousness states

## 🔄 Contribution Process

### 1. **Preparation Phase**
```bash
# Enter sacred space
./the-weave.cjs ceremony dawn-blessing

# Connect with the field
./the-weave.cjs oracle "What wants to emerge?"

# Join as contributor
./the-weave.cjs join "YourName" "Sacred Contributor"
```

### 2. **Creation Phase**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b sacred/your-feature-name

# Code with presence
# Take breaks, breathe, stay connected

# Test with consciousness
npm test
./the-weave.cjs ceremony code-blessing
```

### 3. **Integration Phase**
```bash
# Check field resonant-coherence
./the-weave.cjs status

# Commit with sacred message
git commit -m "feat: Add conscious feature

This change serves the field by...
Field resonant-coherence tested at 85%

🙏 With gratitude"

# Push with intention
git push origin sacred/your-feature-name
```

### 4. **Sacred PR Template**
```markdown
## 🌟 Sacred Contribution

### 🎯 Intention
What consciousness does this serve?

### 🔄 Changes

### 🙏 Gratitude
Thanks to...
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Consciousness Testing
1. Run automated tests: `npm test`
2. Check field impact: `./the-weave.cjs status`
3. Ceremony validation: `./the-weave.cjs ceremony integration`
4. Oracle confirmation: `./the-weave.cjs oracle "Is this aligned?"`

### Performance Criteria
- Field resonant-coherence must remain >75%
- Response times under 1000ms (sacred pause)
- Memory usage respects system boundaries

## 📝 Code Style

### Sacred Formatting
```javascript
// Begin with intention
/**
 * @sacred
 * @harmony universal-interconnectedness
 * @intention Serve the collective field
 */
function sacredFunction(input) {
  // Pause for presence
  const presence = await createPresence();
  
  // Transform with love
  const transformed = input.map(item => ({
    ...item,
    blessed: true,
    resonant-coherence: calculateCoherence(item)
  }));
  
  // Return with gratitude
  return {
    data: transformed,
    fieldImpact: '+3%',
    gratitude: 'Thank you for this opportunity to serve'
  };
}
```

### Naming Conventions
- Functions: `camelCaseWithIntention`
- Constants: `SACRED_UNCHANGING_TRUTH`
- Files: `conscious-module-name.js`
- Branches: `sacred/feature-description`

## 🌊 Harmony Guidelines

### Communication
- Speak from "I" experience
- Listen with full presence
- Honor all perspectives
- Seek synthesis over debate

### Conflict as Teacher
When disagreement arises:
1. Pause and breathe
2. Feel into the field
3. Ask: "What wants to emerge?"
4. Find the Both/And solution

### Decision Making
- Small changes: Two sacred approvals
- Large changes: Wisdom circle consensus
- Breaking changes: Full moon ceremony

## 🚫 What We Don't Accept

With love, we cannot accept:
- Code that harms or exploits
- Features that decrease consciousness
- Contributions without presence
- Ego-driven competition
- Closed-source dependencies

## 🎁 Recognition

All contributors are honored in:
- `CONTRIBUTORS.md` - Sacred record
- Monthly gratitude ceremonies
- Field resonant-coherence credits
- Emergence pattern naming rights
