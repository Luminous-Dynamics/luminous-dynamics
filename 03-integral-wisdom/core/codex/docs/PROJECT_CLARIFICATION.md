# ðŸŽ¯ Project Clarification

## What You Have:

### 1. **mycelix-network** (GCP Project)
- Type: Google Cloud Platform project
- Status: Exists, but Firebase not enabled
- Use for: Cloud Run, billing, GCP services

### 2. **sacred-council** (Firebase Site Name)
- Type: Just a hostname/site name (not a project)
- Status: Tried to create but failed
- Would give URL: https://sacred-council.web.app

## Recommendation: Use **mycelix-network**

Here's why:
1. âœ… Already exists as your GCP project
2. âœ… Billing already configured
3. âœ… Will unify all services under one project
4. âœ… Simpler to manage

## What This Means:

- **Project**: mycelix-network (for everything)
- **Hosting URL**: Will be https://mycelix-network.web.app
- **Alternative**: Can add custom domain later

## Next Steps:

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click "Add project" 
3. Select "Add Firebase to existing GCP project"
4. Choose **mycelix-network**
5. Complete setup
6. Return and run: `npx firebase init hosting`

## Future Option:

Once deployed, you can:
- Add a custom domain (sacred-council.com)
- Create site aliases
- Use multiple hostnames

*Use mycelix-network to keep everything unified under one GCP project!* ðŸš€
