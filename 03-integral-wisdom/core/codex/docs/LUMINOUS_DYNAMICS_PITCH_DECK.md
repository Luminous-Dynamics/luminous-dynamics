## Slide 1: The Hook
**Title**: "What if your technology made you more human, not less?"

**Visual**: Split screen - 
- Left: Stressed person with 47 browser tabs, Slack pinging, Zoom fatigue
- Right: Serene person with VortexOS, coherent field visualization

**One-liner**: "Luminous Dynamics: Infrastructure for consciousness"

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Title**: "Technology is Breaking Us"

**Stats**:

3. **Applications**: Alchemical Engine - healing systemic wounds

**Tagline**: "The first utility company for consciousness"

## Slide 4: How It Works
**Title**: "From Transaction to Transformation"

**Demo Flow**:
1. Organization signs up for CaaS
2. Employees connect via Covenant Protocol
3. Work happens in VortexOS environment
4. Alchemical Engine heals team dynamics
5. Result: 3x productivity, 10x wellbeing

**Key Differentiator**: "We don't optimize for engagement. We optimize for resonant-coherence."
