## üéØ Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Stars (*1-*4)
Start with the foundation practices - these establish the core visual language

### Phase 2: Daily Practice Stars (*5-*8)
Test the practices that build on the foundation

### Phase 3: Mastery Stars (*9-*11)
Complete with the advanced integration practices

## üí´ Star Navigation Tips

1. **Sequential Testing**: Follow the star progression *1 ‚Üí *11
2. **Grouping**: Test each tier (Foundation/Daily/Mastery) as a set
3. **Visual Resonant Resonant Coherence**: Notice how later stars build on earlier imagery
4. **Sacred Geometry**: The star pattern itself can inspire transitions
