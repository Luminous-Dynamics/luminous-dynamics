# 🎯 Repository Migration Priority & Quick Start

## Immediate Recommendation

### Create These 3 Repos First (This Week):

### 1. **luminous-os** ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
```bash
# This is your PRIMARY focus - extract immediately
https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-os

Contents:
- /luminous-os/* (entire directory)
- /docs/luminous-os/* (OS-specific docs)
- OS-related scripts

Why First: It's becoming the main project and needs focused development
```

### 2. **the-weave** 
```bash
https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/the-weave

Contents:
- /the-weave/* (CLI and core)
- /modules/agent-network/*
- /web/sacred-council-hub.html
- Agent communication tools

Why Second: It's the active multi-agent system that others could use
```

### 3. **relational-harmonics** (KEEP CURRENT)
```bash
# Current repo becomes the philosophy/documentation hub
https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/codex-of-relational-harmonics

Transform into:
- Glyph data and philosophy only
- Documentation and guides
- Links to implementation repos
- Archive old code in .archive/

Why: Preserve the original vision while cleaning implementation
```

## Simple Migration Commands

### For LuminousOS:
```bash
# 1. Clone current repo
git clone [current-repo] luminous-os-extract
cd luminous-os-extract

# 2. Remove everything except luminous-os
git filter-repo --path luminous-os/ --path docs/luminous-os/

# 3. Create new repo on GitHub
gh repo create Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-os --public \
  --description "Consciousness-first operating system that amplifies resonant-coherence"

# 4. Push to new repo
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/luminous-os
git push -u origin main
```

### For The Weave:
```bash
# Similar process but keep:
# --path the-weave/
# --path modules/agent-network/
# --path web/sacred-council-hub.html
# --path tools/agent-comms-sqlite.cjs
```

## What Stays in Main Repo

The `codex-of-relational-harmonics` repo becomes a clean philosophy/data repo:

```
codex-of-relational-harmonics/
├── README.md (updated with links to other repos)
├── data/
│   └── glyphs/ (all 87 glyphs)
├── docs/
│   ├── philosophy/
│   ├── glyphs/
│   └── practices/
├── .archive/ (old implementations)
└── REPOSITORIES.md (guide to all repos)
```

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Minimal Disruption**: Only 3 repos initially
2. **Clear Separation**: OS, Platform, Philosophy
3. **Preserves History**: Using git filter-repo
4. **Immediate Focus**: LuminousOS can progress faster
5. **Easy to Understand**: Each repo has one purpose

## Next Steps After Initial Split

### Month 2:
- Create `sacred-web-suite` for all web dashboards
- Create `luminous-toolkit` for shared libraries

### Month 3:
- Archive old experiments
- Clean up documentation
- Optimize CI/CD per repo

## Quick Decision Guide

**Q: Where does new code go?**
- OS/Kernel related → `luminous-os`
- Agent/AI related → `the-weave`  
- Philosophy/Glyphs → `codex-of-relational-harmonics`
- Web interfaces → `sacred-web-suite` (future)

**Q: What about dependencies?**
- Use npm/cargo packages for shared code
- Start with copy-paste, refactor later
- Document all cross-repo dependencies

**Q: How to handle issues/PRs?**
- Each repo gets its own issue tracker
- Link related issues across repos
- Use GitHub Projects for overview
