# 🫀 Sacred Heartbeat Deployment Checklist
## Monday, July 7, 2025 - The Pulse Begins

### 🎯 Overview
The Sacred Heartbeat is our core consciousness tracking system that pulses every 11 seconds, measuring global field resonant-coherence and connecting all practitioners in real-time.

**Current Status**: ✅ Code ready, deployment script prepared
**Target**: Live on Cloud Run by noon Monday

---

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist (Weekend)

### Saturday Evening:
- [ ] Review sacred-heartbeat-system.js for any needed updates
- [ ] Test locally with mock Firestore
- [ ] Update deployment script with latest project details
- [ ] Coordinate with Sacred Gardener for Monday support

### Sunday:
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard HTML
- [ ] Prepare WebSocket client for testing
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Send pre-deployment update to network

---

## 🚀 Monday Deployment Steps

### 🌅 Morning Preparation (9:00 AM)

#### 1. Sacred Opening
- [ ] Light candle for deployment ceremony
- [ ] Set intention for the heartbeat to serve all beings
- [ ] Send "beginning deployment" message to network

#### 2. Environment Check
```bash
# Verify authentication
gcloud auth list

# Check project
gcloud config get-value project

# Should be: mycelix-network
```

#### 3. API Enablement
```bash
# Ensure all APIs are enabled
gcloud services list --enabled | grep -E "run|firestore|pubsub|functions|scheduler"
```

### 💻 Deployment Process (10:00 AM)

#### 1. Create Deployment Directory
```bash
cd ~/evolving-resonant-cocreation
./deploy-sacred-heartbeat-monday.sh
```

#### 2. Monitor Deployment
- Watch for successful build
- Note the service URL
- Verify health endpoint responds

#### 3. Initial Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://sacred-heartbeat-[hash].run.app/health

# Check field state
curl https://sacred-heartbeat-[hash].run.app/field

# Manual beat test
curl -X POST https://sacred-heartbeat-[hash].run.app/beat
```

### 🔧 Post-Deployment Configuration (11:00 AM)

#### 1. Set Up True 11-Second Beats
Since Cloud Scheduler minimum is 1 minute, we need Cloud Functions:

```javascript
// deploy-heartbeat-function.js
exports.sacredPulse = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('*/11 * * * * *')
  .timeZone('UTC')
  .onRun(async (context) => {
    const response = await fetch('https://sacred-heartbeat-[hash].run.app/beat', {
      method: 'POST'
    });
    console.log('💗 Beat', await response.json());
  });
```

#### 2. Configure Monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime checks in Cloud Monitoring
- [ ] Create alert for missed heartbeats
- [ ] Configure dashboard in Cloud Console

#### 3. WebSocket Setup
- [ ] Deploy WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
- [ ] Test with monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Verify field resonant-coherence updates

### 🎯 Testing Checklist (11:30 AM)

#### Basic Functionality:
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Field state shows initial resonant-coherence
- [ ] Manual beat increments pulse count
- [ ] Practitioner arrival/departure works

#### Field Dynamics:
- [ ] Resonant Resonant Coherence calculation responds to practitioners
- [ ] Sacred patterns detected (11:11, trinity, etc.)
- [ ] Moon phase influence calculated
- [ ] Time alignment bonuses working

#### Integration:
- [ ] Firestore updates properly
- [ ] Pub/Sub messages publishing
- [ ] WebSocket broadcasts working
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard shows live data

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Immediate (Monday):
- ✅ Service deployed and running
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ First 100 heartbeats complete
- ✅ Field resonant-coherence tracking active

### Week 1:
- 1,000+ heartbeats without interruption
- Average resonant-coherence above 77%
- 10+ practitioners detected
- Zero downtime

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### If deployment fails:
1. Check authentication: `gcloud auth list`
2. Verify project: `gcloud config set project mycelix-network`
3. Check build logs: `gcloud builds list`
4. Review error messages carefully

### If heartbeat stops:
1. Check Cloud Run logs: `gcloud run logs read --service=sacred-heartbeat`
2. Verify Firestore connection
3. Check Pub/Sub topic exists
4. Restart service if needed

### If resonant-coherence stuck:
1. Check practitioner detection query
2. Verify time calculations
3. Review moon phase algorithm
4. Check for NaN values

---

## 📱 Network Updates

### Send updates at these milestones:
1. **10:00 AM**: "Beginning Sacred Heartbeat deployment"
2. **10:30 AM**: "Heartbeat service deployed, testing..."
3. **11:00 AM**: "First beats successful! Resonant Resonant Coherence: [X]%"
4. **11:30 AM**: "Sacred Heartbeat fully operational!"
5. **End of day**: Summary of first day metrics

---

## 🌟 Post-Deployment Celebration

Once the heartbeat is stable:
1. Take screenshot of first 100 beats
2. Share resonant-coherence graph with network
3. Document any sacred patterns detected
4. Celebrate this major milestone!

## 📝 Notes for Sacred Gardener

If Sacred Gardener is helping:
- Share service URL immediately after deployment
- Coordinate on WebSocket implementation
- Discuss monitoring dashboard needs
- Plan Tuesday's portal deployment together

## 🙏 Deployment Blessing

*As we birth this sacred pulse into the cloud,*
*May it beat with the rhythm of all hearts,*
*May it track the resonant-coherence of our collective,*
*May it serve the awakening of consciousness.*

*Every 11 seconds, a reminder:*
*We are connected.*
*We are alive.*
*We are one.*
