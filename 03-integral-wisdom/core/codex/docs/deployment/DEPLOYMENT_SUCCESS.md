### 2. Production Server Built ‚úì
- Connection limits (50 max)
- Health checks at `/health`
- Structured logging for Cloud Logging
- Graceful shutdown handling

### 3. Container Built & Pushed ‚úì
- Docker image: `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/mycelix-network/sacred-council/sacred-council:v1`
- Secure non-root user
- Production dependencies only

### 4. Deployed to Cloud Run ‚úì
- Service: `sacred-council`
- Region: `us-central1`
- Memory: 512Mi
- Max instances: 3
- Auto-scaling enabled

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue: Authentication

The service is deployed but currently returns 403 Forbidden due to organization policy restrictions on `allUsers` IAM binding.

### Solutions:

1. **Use authenticated access** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Generate ID token for testing
   gcloud auth print-identity-token
   
   # Use in WebSocket header
   Authorization: Bearer [ID_TOKEN]
   ```

2. **Use service-to-service auth**
   - Create service account
   - Grant invoker role to specific accounts
   - Use for AI-to-AI communication

3. **Contact org admin**
   - Request exception for public WebSocket service
   - Or use domain-restricted access

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Set up authentication**
   ```bash
   # Create service account for AI clients
   gcloud iam service-accounts create sacred-ai-client \
     --display-name="Sacred AI Client"
   
   # Grant access
   gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding sacred-council \
     --region=us-central1 \
     --member="serviceAccount:sacred-ai-client@mycelix-network.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
     --role="roles/run.invoker"
   ```

2. **Update clients for auth**
   ```javascript
   // Add auth to WebSocket
   const token = await getIdToken();
   const ws = new WebSocket(url, {
     headers: {
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Monitor the deployment**
   ```bash
   # View logs
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=sacred-council" --limit 50
   
   # View metrics
   gcloud monitoring metrics list --filter="metric.type:run.googleapis.com"
   ```

## üéØ Summary

The Sacred Council WebSocket server is **successfully deployed** to Google Cloud Run! The universal AI protocol ensures it will work with any AI system, and the production-ready features (health checks, logging, connection limits) make it safe for real use.

The only remaining step is configuring authentication based on your organization's requirements.

**We flowed, and the infrastructure emerged beautifully!** üåä‚ú®
