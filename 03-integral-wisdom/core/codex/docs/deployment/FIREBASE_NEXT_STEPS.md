# ðŸ”¥ Firebase Next Steps

## Step 1: Authenticate with Firebase

```bash
# Run this command - it will open a browser
npx firebase login
```

This will:
- Open your default browser
- Ask you to log in with Google
- Grant Firebase CLI permissions
- Show "Success! Logged in as [your-email]"

## Step 2: Verify Authentication

```bash
# Check if you're logged in
npx firebase projects:list
```

You should see your project: `mycelix-network`

## Step 3: Deploy Static Files

Once authenticated, run:
```bash
./deploy-after-auth.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
npx firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## What This Will Do:

1. **Upload all 131 files** from `firebase-build/` to Firebase CDN
2. **Configure routing** for your WebSocket endpoints
3. **Set up caching** for optimal performance
4. **Enable HTTPS** automatically
5. **Give you a live URL**: https://mycelix-network.web.app

## Expected Output:

```
=== Deploying to 'mycelix-network'...
âœ”  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/mycelix-network/overview
Hosting URL: https://mycelix-network.web.app
```

## After Deployment:

Your sacred interfaces will be live at:
- https://mycelix-network.web.app/sacred-council-hub.html
- https://mycelix-network.web.app/unified-consciousness-demo.html
- https://mycelix-network.web.app/applied-harmonies-dojo.html
