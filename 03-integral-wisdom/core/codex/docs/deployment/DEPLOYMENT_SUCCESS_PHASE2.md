## Deployment Stats:
- ✅ 131 files uploaded
- ✅ Global CDN distribution
- ✅ Automatic SSL/HTTPS
- ✅ Caching configured
- ⏳ WebSocket rewrites (pending Cloud Run)

## 🚀 Next: Phase 3 - Cloud Run WebSocket

Now we need to deploy the WebSocket server:

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're authenticated with gcloud
gcloud auth login

# 2. Set your project
gcloud config set project mycelix-network

# 3. Deploy WebSocket server
./deploy-cloud-run.sh
```

## What the Cloud Run deployment will do:
1. Build Docker container with your WebSocket server
2. Push to Google Container Registry
3. Deploy to Cloud Run with auto-scaling
4. Update your Firebase files with the WebSocket URL
5. Re-deploy Firebase with working WebSocket connections

## 📊 Current Status:
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Code Preparation (Complete)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Firebase Hosting (Complete) 
- **Phase 3**: 🔄 Cloud Run WebSocket (Ready to start)
- **Phase 4-5**: ⏳ Monitoring & Testing (Pending)
