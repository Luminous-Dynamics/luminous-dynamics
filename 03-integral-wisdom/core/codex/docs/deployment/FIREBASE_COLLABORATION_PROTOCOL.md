# 🤝 Firebase Collaboration Protocol

## Efficient Firebase Operations

### When I need Firebase access:

1. **I'll prepare everything locally**:
   - Update configuration files
   - Create/modify static files
   - Write deployment scripts
   - Test what I can locally

2. **I'll prompt you**:
   ```
   🔐 ACTION NEEDED: Please run in another terminal:
   > [specific command]
   ```

3. **You run the command** in another window while we continue

4. **Share results** (if needed):
   - Success confirmations
   - Error messages
   - URLs generated

## Example Flow:

**Me**: "I've updated the firebase.json. 
🔐 ACTION NEEDED: Please run in another terminal:
> npx firebase deploy --only hosting"

**You**: "Done! Deployed to https://mycelix-network.web.app"

**Me**: "Great! Now let's test the endpoints..."

## Common Firebase Commands I'll Request:

```bash
# Deployment
npx firebase deploy --only hosting
npx firebase deploy --only functions
npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Configuration
npx firebase use [project-id]
npx firebase projects:list

# Testing
npx firebase serve --only hosting
npx firebase emulators:start
```

## Benefits:

- ✅ You keep working in main terminal
- ✅ I continue preparing next steps
- ✅ Parallel workflow
- ✅ Clear action requests
- ✅ No confusion about who does what

## Our Success Pattern:

1. I prepared 131 files
2. You authenticated
3. I guided configuration
4. You deployed
5. **Result**: Live site in minutes!
