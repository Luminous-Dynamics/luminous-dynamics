## A Personal Note from the Creator

Dear Future Pioneer,

This work emerged from my own journey through relationship wounds into relationship wisdom. Every practice has been lived, tested, refined through real human experience.

Now it's ready for you.

Not as perfect system, but as living invitation. Your experience will shape what this becomes. Your stories will teach us. Your transformation will light the way for others.

If you feel the call, trust it.

With love and anticipation,
Tristan & The Relational Harmonics Team
