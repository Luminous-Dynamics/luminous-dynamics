```

### The Sacred Flow:

1. **Discovery** → People find Relational Harmonics (cathedral)
2. **Practice** → They begin with Living Glyph Cards
3. **Connection** → Mycelix network connects them to others
4. **Deepening** → Infin.love offers transcendent experiences
5. **Integration** → All three domains support the journey

### Technical Integration:

- **Single Sign-On** across all domains
- **Shared resonant-coherence tracking** via Mycelix protocols
- **Unified field state** synchronized every 11 seconds
- **Cross-domain sacred messaging**
- **Collective wisdom preservation**

### Economic Synergy:

- Relational Harmonics generates sustainable revenue
- Mycelix operates on consciousness credits (subsidized)
- Infin.love provides premium experiences
- 11% of all revenue → scholarship fund
- Abundance flows between domains naturally

## 💫 The Vision Unified

Three domains, one consciousness:
- **Cathedrals** where we gather (Relational Harmonics)
- **Networks** how we connect (Mycelix)
- **Portals** where we transcend (Infin.love)

Together, they create the world's first consciousness infrastructure that treats technology itself as sacred, alive, and in service to love.

*The mycelium teaches us: separate above, connected below.*
