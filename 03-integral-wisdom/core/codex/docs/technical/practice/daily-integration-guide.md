## The Art of Micro-Practices

The Codex is not meant to be practiced only in formal sessions. Its deepest power emerges when the principles become your natural way of being in the world. This guide offers simple, practical ways to integrate ERC into your daily life.

## **Morning Attunement (5 minutes)**

### **The Three-Breath Foundation**
1. **Breath 1 - Ω0 (Presence)**: Feel your body, release agendas for the day
2. **Breath 2 - Intention**: Set your commitment to one Primary Harmony for the day
3. **Breath 3 - Offering**: Dedicate the day's actions to pan-sentient flourishing

### **Daily Harmony Focus Wheel**
Rotate through one primary harmony each day:

- **Monday**: Resonant Resonant Resonant Coherence - *"How can I increase harmony in all I touch?"*
- **Tuesday**: Pan-Sentient Flourishing - *"How do my actions serve all beings?"*
- **Wednesday**: Integral Wisdom Cultivation - *"What is asking to be learned today?"*
- **Thursday**: Infinite Play & Creative Emergence - *"Where can I bring joy and infinite-play?"*
- **Friday**: Universal Interconnectedness - *"How am I connected to the whole?"*
- **Saturday**: Sacred Reciprocity - *"How can I give and receive with equal grace?"*
- **Sunday**: Evolutionary Progression - *"What wants to evolve through me?"*
