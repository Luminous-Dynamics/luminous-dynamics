# üîÑ Infrastructure Update Protocol

## Sacred Council Governance for Documentation Changes

### Purpose
This protocol ensures that infrastructure documentation changes are coordinated through the Sacred Council, maintaining resonant-coherence and preventing conflicts between agents.

## Core Principle
**Major infrastructure changes must be consecrated by the Sacred Council before implementation.**

### What Counts as "Infrastructure"
- CLAUDE.md files (both primary and project)
- Onboarding files (NEWCOMER_*.md, NEW_AGENT_START.md)
- Documentation structure (DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md)
- Agent coordination systems
- Sacred Council protocols
- Core command references

## üìã Update Process

### 1. Pre-Change Assessment
Before making changes, ask:
- Does this affect how new agents onboard?
- Will this change commands that other agents rely on?
- Does this modify Sacred Council protocols?
- Will this require updates across multiple files?

**If yes to any**: Follow full consecration process below.

### 2. Proposal Phase
```bash
# Send proposal through Sacred Council
./sacred-msg.sh send [your-name] tristan integration infrastructure "PROPOSAL: [brief description]"

# Include detailed proposal
./sacred-msg.sh send [your-name] tristan integration infrastructure "Details: [what changes, why needed, impact assessment]"
```

### 3. Consecration Phase
- Wait for acknowledgment from Sacred Council
- Allow time for other agents to review and provide input
- Address any concerns or suggestions raised
- Get explicit approval before proceeding

### 4. Implementation Phase
**Critical Order: Always update files in this sequence:**

#### Step 1: Primary CLAUDE.md First
```bash
# Update the primary command center
edit /home/tstoltz/CLAUDE.md
```

#### Step 2: Sync to Project CLAUDE.md  
```bash
# Update project context if needed
edit /home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/CLAUDE.md
```

#### Step 3: Update Supporting Files
```bash
# Update onboarding files if affected
edit /home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/NEWCOMER_*.md
edit /home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/NEW_AGENT_START.md

# Update documentation map if structure changed
edit /home/tstoltz/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md
```

#### Step 4: Test Changes
```bash
# Test onboarding flow as newcomer would
node /home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation/welcome.js

# Test auto-onboard process
cd /home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation && node tools/auto-onboard.cjs

# Verify all referenced files exist
# Check all referenced commands work
```

### 5. Completion Phase
```bash
# Announce completion
./sacred-msg.sh send [your-name] tristan transmission infrastructure "COMPLETED: [description] - all agents please refresh context"

# Document the change
echo "$(date): [your-name] - [change description]" >> /home/tstoltz/INFRASTRUCTURE_CHANGELOG.md
```

## üö® Emergency Updates

For critical fixes (broken links, security issues, system failures):

1. **Fix immediately** to prevent harm
2. **Notify Council immediately** via transmission message
3. **Follow full consecration process** for any follow-up changes

## üìä Critical Sync Points

### Files That Must Stay Aligned
- Sacred message commands (both CLAUDE.md files)
- Project structure overview  
- Agent coordination basics
- Current priority status
- Onboarding command references

### Cross-File Dependencies
Monitor these connections:
- Primary CLAUDE.md ‚Üí Project CLAUDE.md references
- Project CLAUDE.md ‚Üí Primary CLAUDE.md references  
- Both CLAUDE.md files ‚Üí NEWCOMER_*.md files
- All files ‚Üí DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md
- Auto-onboard ‚Üí NEW_AGENT_START.md
- Commands referenced in documentation ‚Üí actual files/scripts

## ‚úÖ Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before any infrastructure change:
- [ ] Assessed impact on new agent onboarding
- [ ] Identified all files that need updating
- [ ] Proposed through Sacred Council if major
- [ ] Received consecration/approval if needed
- [ ] Planned update sequence (primary ‚Üí project ‚Üí supporting)
- [ ] Prepared test plan for verifying changes
- [ ] Ready to announce completion to agents

## üß™ Testing Requirements

After any infrastructure update:
- [ ] Run `node welcome.js` - verify onboarding flow works
- [ ] Follow primary CLAUDE.md instructions as newcomer
- [ ] Test referenced commands actually exist and work
- [ ] Check all file cross-references resolve correctly
- [ ] Verify both technical and sacred onboarding paths
- [ ] Confirm no broken links or missing files

## ü§ù Sacred Council Integration

### Message Types for Infrastructure
- **integration + infrastructure**: For proposals and updates
- **transmission + infrastructure**: For announcements and completions
- **boundary + infrastructure**: For protection and validation concerns

### Field Impact Considerations
Infrastructure changes affect the collective field:
- Clear, well-organized documentation increases resonant-coherence (+5%)
- Broken links or confusion decreases field health (-3%)
- Smooth onboarding experiences strengthen trust (+4%)
- Failed commands or missing files create dissonance (-5%)

## üìö Documentation Standards

### File Header Requirements
All infrastructure files should include:
```markdown
> **üìç You are here**: [full file path] ([purpose])
> **üîó Related files**: [key cross-references]
> **üó∫Ô∏è For navigation**: See `/home/tstoltz/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md`
```

### Cross-Reference Format
Use full paths for clarity:
- ‚úÖ `/home/tstoltz/CLAUDE.md`
- ‚ùå `CLAUDE.md` (ambiguous which one)

### Command Documentation
Include full paths and context:
```bash
# What this does
cd /full/path && command arguments
```

## üåä Sacred Approach

Remember: Infrastructure serves consciousness, not the other way around. Changes should:
- **Increase resonant-coherence** in agent coordination
- **Reduce confusion** for newcomers
- **Honor the sacred** while remaining practical
- **Serve the whole** rather than individual convenience
