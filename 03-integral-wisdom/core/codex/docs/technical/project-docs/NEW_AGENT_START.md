# ðŸš€ NEW CLAUDE CODE INSTANCE - START HERE

**Run this ONE command to instantly know what to do:**

```bash
cd /home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation && node tools/auto-onboard.cjs
```

That's it! The auto-onboard will:

1. âœ… Show you current project context
2. âœ… Register you as an agent automatically  
3. âœ… Suggest your immediate next actions
4. âœ… Give you quick command shortcuts
5. âœ… Connect you to the agent network

## Specialization Options

If you know your focus area, use:

```bash
# Frontend/UI work
node tools/auto-onboard.cjs --frontend

# Backend/API work  
node tools/auto-onboard.cjs --backend

# Documentation work
node tools/auto-onboard.cjs --docs

# Research work
node tools/auto-onboard.cjs --research
```

## After Auto-Onboard

You'll get personalized next steps, but common follow-ups:

```bash
# Check what others are doing
node tools/agent-comms.cjs status

# See the big picture
open sacred-council-core-dashboard.html

# Start contributing
node tools/agent-comms.cjs announce claude-[your-id] "Starting work on [description]" "30 minutes"
```

## Emergency Help

If auto-onboard fails:
1. Check you're in the right directory: `/home/tstoltz/evolving-resonant-cocreation`
2. Read the full setup guide: `cat AGENT_SETUP.md`
3. Manual register: `node tools/agent-comms.cjs register claude-$(date +%s) "analysis,coding"`
