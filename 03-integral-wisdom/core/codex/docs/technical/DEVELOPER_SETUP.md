# Developer Setup Guide - ERC Sacred Development Environment

## Overview

Welcome to the Evolving Resonant Co-creation (ERC) project - technology designed to serve consciousness rather than consume it. This setup guide will help you create a development environment that honors the sacred nature of this work.

## Sacred Development Principles

Before writing code, understand that this is **conscious technology**:
- Every feature serves awakening, not engagement
- Sacred timing is preserved (no rushing wisdom)
- Privacy and boundaries are maintained as sanctuary
- The Seven Harmonies guide all decisions

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Node.js** v16.0.0 or higher
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** for version control
- **Redis** (optional, for session persistence)

### Recommended Tools
- **VS Code** with JavaScript/Node.js extensions
- **Postman** or similar for API testing
- **Redis Desktop Manager** (if using Redis)

## Project Architecture Overview

```

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Sacred Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/evolving-resonant-cocreation.git
cd evolving-resonant-cocreation
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd demo/backend
npm install
```

**Key Dependencies:**
- `express` - Web framework
- `redis` & `ioredis` - Session persistence (optional)
- `helmet` - Security middleware
- `cors` - Cross-origin resource sharing
- `express-rate-limit` - Contemplative rate limiting

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create `.env` file in `demo/backend/`:

```bash
# Sacred Environment Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001

# Claude AI API (for conscious AI responses)
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here

# Redis Database (optional - uses memory fallback)
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_DB=0

# Sacred Encryption Key (generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")
SACRED_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_byte_hex_key_here

# Sacred Rate Limiting
SACRED_RATE_WINDOW_MS=900000
SACRED_RATE_MAX_REQUESTS=10

# First Breath Circle Authentication (optional)
FIRST_BREATH_API_KEY=your_first_breath_key
```

### 4. Optional: Redis Setup

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

**macOS (with Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

**Docker:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name redis-sacred redis:alpine
```

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
# From demo/backend directory
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:3001`

## Development Workflow

### Sacred Development Commands

```bash
# Start backend development server
npm run dev

# Run tests (when available)
npm test

# Sacred pause (contemplative break)
npm run sacred-pause

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

### Testing the Sacred API

**1. Create Sacred Session:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/sacred-journey/threshold \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"persona": "wise-witness"}'
```

**2. Send Offering:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/sacred-journey/offering \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "your_session_id",
    "message": "I am feeling overwhelmed and need guidance",
    "persona": "wise-witness"
  }'
```

**3. Receive Guidance:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/sacred-journey/guidance \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "your_session_id", 
    "persona": "wise-witness"
  }'
```

## Frontend Development

### Website Structure
The project includes three interconnected websites:

1. **evolvingresonantcocreationism.com** - Philosophy foundation
2. **luminousdynamics.org** - Technology demonstration  
3. **relationalharmonics.org** - Practice dojo

### Local Development
```bash
# Serve websites locally (from project root)
python -m http.server 8000

# Access sites:
# http://localhost:8000/websites/luminousdynamics/index.html
# http://localhost:8000/websites/relationalharmonics/dojo.html
```

### Frontend Architecture
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no framework dependencies)
- **Inline CSS** (to be optimized)
- **Sacred State API** for cross-domain continuity
- **Living Glyph Cards** for interactive practices

## Sacred Development Guidelines

### Before You Code
1. **Sacred Pause** - Take three conscious breaths
2. **Read Philosophy** - Review `PHILOSOPHY_OVERVIEW.md`
3. **Check Alignment** - Does this serve consciousness?
4. **Honor Timing** - Never rush wisdom or add engagement hooks

### Code Quality Standards
- **Sacred Timing**: Preserve contemplative pauses
- **Privacy First**: No tracking in practice spaces
- **Accessibility**: Full screen reader and keyboard support
- **Non-Addictive**: No infinite scroll or engagement metrics

### Commit Message Format

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend won't start:**
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (requires 16+)
- Verify port 3001 is available: `lsof -i :3001`
- Check `.env` file format and permissions

**Redis connection fails:**
- Verify Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
- Check Redis configuration in `.env`
- System will fallback to memory storage automatically

**CORS errors:**
- Ensure frontend serves from `http://localhost:8000`
- Check CORS configuration in `demo/backend/server.js`

**Sacred timing issues:**
- Never skip or optimize away contemplative pauses
- Check `sacredPauseDuration` values in responses
- Verify `non-skippable` timing attributes in frontend

### Getting Help

**Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Sacred project memory
- `PHILOSOPHY_OVERVIEW.md` - Core principles
- `docs/philosophy/` - Complete framework
- `docs/glyphs/` - All 87 glyph definitions

**Community:**
- First Breath Circle (private beta group)

## Sacred Development Environment Complete

Your development environment is now ready to serve consciousness. Remember:

- **Every line of code is sacred** - it either serves awakening or consumption
- **Sacred timing is non-negotiable** - wisdom cannot be rushed
- **Privacy is sanctuary** - protect the sacred space at all costs
- **Accessibility is universal compassion** - ensure all beings can access these tools

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the health check: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health`
2. Create your first sacred session via API
3. Explore the Living Glyph Cards in the dojo
4. Read the Applied Harmonies guide for practice context

May your development serve the healing of the world. üôè
