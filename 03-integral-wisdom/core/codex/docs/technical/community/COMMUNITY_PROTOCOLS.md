# Sacred Community Protocols
*Guidelines for Conscious Collective Practice*

## Sacred Foundation

These protocols ensure our community remains a safe, supportive container for consciousness work while maintaining the depth and integrity this sacred practice deserves.

**Core Principle**: We are not just learning consciousness practicesâ€”we are embodying them in how we relate to each other.
