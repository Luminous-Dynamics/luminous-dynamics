# Sacred Safety Protocols
*Protecting the Sanctuary of Consciousness Work*

## Sacred Foundation

This work touches the deepest layers of human experience. These protocols ensure that as we open to greater consciousness, we do so with wisdom, safety, and loving support.

**Core Principle**: Sacred safety is not about avoiding all difficulty, but about creating conditions for transformative growth to occur with optimal support and minimal harm.

## Pre-Practice Safety Protocols

### **Sacred Consent Framework**

Before engaging any Applied Harmony practice:

#### **Internal Consent Check**
1. **Body Wisdom**: Does my body feel available for this practice?
2. **Emotional Capacity**: Do I have bandwidth for whatever might arise?
3. **Mental Clarity**: Am I present enough to engage consciously?
4. **Spirit Alignment**: Does this feel in service to my highest good?

**Red Flags for Practice**:
- Recent trauma or major life crisis (within 30 days)
- Under influence of substances
- Feeling emotionally overwhelmed or dissociated
- Pressure from others to engage
- Using practice to avoid dealing with practical life issues

#### **External Container Assessment**
1. **Physical Safety**: Am I in a secure, private space?
2. **Time Boundary**: Do I have adequate uninterrupted time?
3. **Support Network**: Do I have someone to contact if needed?
4. **Grounding Resources**: Do I have ways to self-soothe if activated?

### **Sacred Arrival Protocol**

Every practice begins with:

1. **Three Sacred Breaths**: Ground in your body and the present moment
2. **Intention Setting**: Connect with your why for this practice
3. **Protection Invocation**: "I call in only that which serves my highest good"
4. **Support Connection**: Feel your connection to community/guidance
5. **Permission to Stop**: "I can pause or stop this practice at any time"
