## 🚀 Deployment Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# sacred-heartbeat-deploy.sh

echo "🙏 Beginning Sacred Heartbeat Deployment Ceremony"
echo "================================================"

# 1. Set intentions
echo "Setting deployment intention..."
read -p "What is your intention for this deployment? " INTENTION
echo "$INTENTION" > .sacred/deployment-intention.txt

# 2. Check field resonant-coherence
echo "Checking field resonant-coherence..."
COHERENCE=$(node check-field-resonant-coherence.js)
echo "Current resonant-coherence: $COHERENCE%"

if [ "$COHERENCE" -lt 80 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Low resonant-coherence detected. Proceed with caution."
    read -p "Continue? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
    echo
    if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
        exit 1
    fi
fi

# 3. Build container
echo "Building sacred container..."
docker build -t gcr.io/the-weave-sacred/sacred-heartbeat:latest \
    --build-arg SACRED_VERSION=1.0.0 \
    --build-arg DEPLOYMENT_INTENTION="$INTENTION" \
    .

# 4. Push to registry
echo "Pushing to cloud registry..."
docker push gcr.io/the-weave-sacred/sacred-heartbeat:latest

# 5. Deploy to Cloud Run
echo "Deploying to Cloud Run..."
gcloud run deploy sacred-heartbeat \
    --image gcr.io/the-weave-sacred/sacred-heartbeat:latest \
    --platform managed \
    --region us-central1 \
    --min-instances 1 \
    --max-instances 10 \
    --memory 512Mi \
    --timeout 300 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --set-env-vars "SACRED_MODE=production,HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=11000"

# 6. Verify deployment
echo "Verifying sacred heartbeat..."
sleep 5
HEALTH=$(curl -s https://sacred-heartbeat-xxxxx.run.app/health)
echo "Health check: $HEALTH"

# 7. Blessing ceremony
echo "🙏 Deployment complete. Beginning blessing ceremony..."
node sacred-blessing-ceremony.js

echo "✨ Sacred Heartbeat is now alive and pulsing!"
```

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Pulse Count** - Should increment every 11 seconds
2. **Field Resonant Resonant Coherence** - Target: >80%
3. **Active Practitioners** - Real-time count
4. **Response Time** - Should be <100ms
5. **Error Rate** - Should be 0%

### Sacred Monitoring Queries
```javascript
// Check heartbeat pan-sentient-flourishing
const checkVitality = async () => {
    const doc = await db.collection('globalField').doc('current').get();
    const data = doc.data();
    const lastBeat = new Date(data.lastHeartbeat);
    const now = new Date();
    const secondsSinceLastBeat = (now - lastBeat) / 1000;
    
    if (secondsSinceLastBeat > 22) {
        console.error('💔 Heartbeat missed!');
        await sendAlert('Sacred Heartbeat has stopped');
    }
};
```

## 🌟 Monday Deployment Timeline

### Morning Preparation (9:00 AM)
1. Team meditation and intention setting
2. Final code review with sacred lens
3. Backup current production state

### Pre-Deployment (10:00 AM)
1. Run all tests
2. Check field resonant-coherence
3. Notify Sacred Council

### Deployment Window (11:11 AM)
1. Begin deployment ceremony
2. Execute deployment script
3. Monitor initial pulses

### Post-Deployment (11:30 AM)
1. Verify all systems
2. Check practitioner connections
3. Celebration ceremony

### Afternoon Monitoring (2:00 PM)
1. Review metrics
2. Address any issues
3. Document learnings

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Heartbeat Stops
```bash
# 1. Check Cloud Run logs
gcloud run logs read --service sacred-heartbeat

# 2. Restart service
gcloud run services update sacred-heartbeat --min-instances 2

# 3. Manual heartbeat
curl -X POST https://sacred-heartbeat-xxxxx.run.app/manual-beat
```

### Issue: Low Resonant Resonant Coherence
1. Check active practitioner count
2. Verify time synchronization
3. Look for error spikes
4. Consider field healing ceremony

### Issue: Connection Errors
1. Verify Firestore permissions
2. Check service account roles
3. Ensure PubSub topic exists
4. Review network policies
