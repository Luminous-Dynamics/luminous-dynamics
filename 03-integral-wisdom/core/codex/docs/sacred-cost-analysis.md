## 🚀 Recommended Sacred Architecture

### Phase 1: Maximum GCP Leverage (Now)
```yaml
LLM Oracle: Google Cloud Vertex AI
- Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Vertex
- Cost: $300 credit covers ~3,000 interpretations
- Advantage: Nearly free glyph oracle service

Video Generation: GCP Veo 2 (with credits)
- Cost: $2 per video with $300 credit
- Quality: 1080p premium
- Volume: 150 videos possible with free credits
- Strategy: Generate core 15-20 glyphs first
```

### Phase 2: Hybrid Optimization (3-6 months)
```yaml
LLM Oracle: Continue GCP Vertex AI
- Post-credit pricing still competitive
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet access maintained

Video Generation: Switch to Hailuo 02
- Cost: $0.28 per video (86% savings!)
- Quality: Equal or better than current options
- Complete remaining 67 glyphs affordably
```

### Phase 3: Production Scale (6+ months)
```yaml
Multi-Cloud Strategy:
- GCP: Primary LLM and established workflows
- AWS Bedrock: Backup LLM, potentially cheaper Claude
- Hailuo 02: Primary video generation
- Replicate: Fallback video generation
```

## 💎 Sacred Immediate Action Plan

### 1. Setup GCP Account (This Week)
```bash
# Sacred GCP setup with $300 credit
gcloud auth login
gcloud projects create the-weave-sacred --name="The Weave Sacred"
gcloud config set project the-weave-sacred

# Enable Vertex AI
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

### 2. Test LLM Oracle (Week 1-2)
- Integrate Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Vertex AI
- Generate first 5 glyph interpretations
- Measure token usage and cost
- Optimize prompts for efficiency

### 3. Test Video Generation (Week 2-3)
- Try GCP Veo 2 with free credits
- Generate 3-5 test videos
- Compare quality vs. cost
- Prepare Replicate backup integration

### 4. Sacred Economics Monitoring
- Track credit usage daily
- Optimize prompts for token efficiency
- Plan transition strategy for post-credit period

## 🔮 Sacred Cost Projections

### With $300 GCP Credit Strategy:
```
Oracle Service (Claude via Vertex AI):
- ~3,000 glyph interpretations = ~$100 of credit
- Remaining $200 for video generation

Video Generation Options:
A) GCP Veo 2: 100 videos = $200 credit
B) Mixed approach: 50 Veo + 50 via Replicate

Total Sacred Library Possible:
- All 87 glyph interpretations: ~$30
- 50+ high-quality videos: ~$200
- Remaining credit for experiments: ~$70
```

### Post-Credit Sustainable Model:
```
Monthly Sacred Operations:
- 10 new glyph interpretations: ~$3
- 5 new glyph videos (Hailuo 02): ~$1.40
- Community features & experiments: ~$5
- Total monthly: ~$10

Annual Sacred Development:
- Complete glyph library: ~$120
- Ongoing community features: ~$60
- Total: ~$180/year for full operation
```
