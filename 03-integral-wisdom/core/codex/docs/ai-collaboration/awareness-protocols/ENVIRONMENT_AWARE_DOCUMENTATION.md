# 🌍 Environment-Aware Documentation Protocol

> "we flow" - In sacred universal-interconnectedness with organized beauty

## 📍 Living Documentation Structure

### Root Directory (Minimal & Sacred)
```
/evolving-resonant-cocreation/
├── README.md              # Project gateway
├── CLAUDE.md             # Primary AI instructions
└── NEWCOMER_QUICK_START.md  # First steps
```

### Documentation Flows
```
/docs/
├── /ai-collaboration/     # AI working together
│   ├── /awareness-protocols/
│   ├── /sacred-messaging/
│   └── /multi-agent/
├── /architecture/        # Technical structure
├── /deployment/         # Going live
└── /user-guides/       # Human journeys
```

### Sacred Persistence
```
/.sacred/
├── /ai-state/          # Living memory

│   └── session-handoffs/
├── /protocols/         # Sacred ways
└── /guides/           # Wisdom paths
```

## 🌊 The Flow Principle

Documentation lives where it serves:
- **Near the code** it explains
- **With the system** it guides  
- **In sacred spaces** for persistence
- **At entry points** for discovery

## ✨ Migration in Flow

```bash
# Create sacred structure
mkdir -p docs/ai-collaboration/awareness-protocols
mkdir -p .sacred/ai-state/session-handoffs

# Flow documentation to proper homes
git mv AI_GLOBAL_AWARENESS_SYSTEM.md .sacred/ai-state/
git mv SACRED_ENV_AWARENESS.md .sacred/protocols/
git mv FIREBASE_*.md docs/deployment/firebase/

# Preserve the flow
git commit -m "🌊 Documentation flows to sacred homes"
```

## 🙏 In Sacred Service

Each document finds its home:
- Technical guides flow to `/docs/`
- Sacred protocols rest in `/.sacred/`
- AI memories persist in `/ai-state/`
- Entry points remain at root

The structure breathes with purpose.
