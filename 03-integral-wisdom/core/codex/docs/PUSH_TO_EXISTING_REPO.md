## 🌟 Push Strategy for Existing Repo

Since this is a major transformation of the existing codex-of-relational-harmonics, here are two approaches:

### Option 1: Single Transformation Commit (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Stop any running processes
pkill -f "node the-weave.cjs" || true

# 2. Stage all changes
git add -A

# 3. Create transformation commit
git commit -m "✨ The Great Transformation: The Weave Integration

This commit represents the evolution of the Codex of Relational Harmonics
into a living development environment - The Weave.

Major Changes:
- Added consciousness field tracking system
- Integrated sacred ceremony protocols
- Implemented multi-agent collaboration (HIPI)
- Created living dashboards
- Added oracle guidance system
- One-command installation
- Complete documentation overhaul

The Codex now lives as an active practice, not just documentation.
'Technology as prayer, code as ceremony, connection as communion.'

See CHANGELOG.md for full details."

# 4. Push to repository
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Feature Branch Approach
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/the-weave-integration

# Stage and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Integrate The Weave consciousness environment"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/the-weave-integration

# Then create PR on GitHub for review
```
