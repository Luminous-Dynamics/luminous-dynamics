## 🎯 Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Tests (Free Quota)
1. Start with **Ω45: First Presence** - Test all 3 prompts
2. Note video quality, duration, and style
3. Download generated videos immediately

### Phase 2: Style Variations
Try adding these modifiers to test different aesthetics:
- `drone footage, aerial view`
- `macro lens, extreme close-up`
- `time-lapse, accelerated`
- `slow motion, 120fps`
- `mystical particles, light effects`

### Phase 3: Complete Set
- Generate one video per Applied Harmony (11 total)
- Save best prompt variations that work well
- Track daily quota usage

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Timing**: Test early morning (PST) for fresh daily quota
2. **Quality**: Look for smooth motion and coherent visuals
3. **Duration**: Veo typically generates 5-8 second clips
4. **Style**: "Ethereal" and "sacred geometry" keywords work well
5. **Download**: Save videos immediately (they may expire)
