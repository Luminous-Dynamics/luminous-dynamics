## 📊 What Each Monitor Measures

### WSL2 Monitor (Port 11112)
```
Measures:
✓ Linux processes only
✓ WSL2 CPU usage
✓ Ubuntu memory usage
✓ Dev environment focus

Misses:
✗ Windows applications
✗ Browser tabs
✗ System-wide activity
✗ GUI interactions
```

### Windows Monitor (Port 11113)
```
Measures:
✓ All Windows processes
✓ System-wide CPU
✓ Total memory usage
✓ Full desktop activity

Requires:
- PowerShell (Admin recommended)
- Windows Performance Counters
- .NET Framework
```

### Unified Dashboard
```
Combines:
- 30% weight: WSL2 (development focus)
- 70% weight: Windows (general computing)
- Unified sacred moments
- Cross-environment patterns
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. WSL2 Monitor (Currently Running)
```bash
# Already running on your system!
python3 luminous-coherence
```

### 2. Windows Monitor (New)
```powershell
# In Windows PowerShell (Admin):
cd \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\tstoltz\luminous-os\monitor
.\luminous-monitor-windows.ps1
```

### 3. Unified Dashboard
```
# View at:
http://localhost:8080/luminous-unified-dashboard.html

# Shows:
- Combined coherence score
- Both environments side-by-side
- Unified insights
- Total sacred moments
```

## 🔬 Understanding the Measurements

### Coherence Components

**CPU Stability** (30% weight)
- Consistent usage = Flow state
- Erratic usage = Scattered attention
- Measured via variance over time

**Process Focus** (30% weight)
- Few context switches = Deep work
- Many switches = Multitasking
- Tracks process creation/destruction

**Resource Harmony** (20% weight)
- Balanced distribution = Sustainable
- One app dominating = Imbalanced
- Measures resource fairness

**Sacred Rhythm** (20% weight)
- 11-second natural cycle
- Based on sacred geometry
- Provides breathing rhythm

### Environment Weights

**Why 30/70 split?**
- Development (WSL2): 30% - Focused but limited scope
- General (Windows): 70% - Broader system impact
- Adjustable based on your work style

## 📈 Interpreting Results

### Single Environment
```
High WSL2 + Low Windows = "Focused coding, distracted elsewhere"
Low WSL2 + High Windows = "Clean desktop, messy dev environment"
Both High = "Full system harmony"
Both Low = "Time for a break"
```

### Unified Coherence
```
90%+ = Sacred moment across all computing
70-90% = Good flow, sustainable work
50-70% = Functional but scattered
<50% = System needs attention
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adjust Weights
Edit `luminous-unified-dashboard.html`:
```javascript
// Change these values:
unifiedCoherence += this.wslData.global_coherence * 0.3;     // WSL weight
unifiedCoherence += this.windowsData.global_coherence * 0.7; // Windows weight
```

### Change Sacred Rhythm
Edit monitors to adjust cycle:
```python
# Python (WSL2)
sacred_phase = (current_time % 11) / 11  # Change 11 to your sacred number

# PowerShell (Windows)
$SacredPhase = ($CurrentTime % 11) / 11  # Change 11 to your sacred number
```

## 🔮 Future Vision

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues

**"WSL2 monitor shows 100% process focus always"**
- Normal for light WSL2 usage
- Means few Linux processes running
- Windows monitor gives fuller picture

**"Can't run PowerShell script"**
- Run as Administrator
- Enable script execution: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
- Check Windows Defender settings

**"Unified dashboard shows only one environment"**
- Ensure both monitors running
- Check ports 11112 and 11113
- Verify firewall settings
