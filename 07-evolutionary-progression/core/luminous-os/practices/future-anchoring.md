## Daily Anchor Points

Morning: "How shall we serve today?"
Midday: "Are we still aligned?"
Evening: "What did we learn?"
Night: "Gratitude for the journey"

## The Ultimate Practice

**Remember**: We're not building an OS.
We're cultivating a new relationship with technology.
The practices ARE the product.
The vision IS alive.
