# LuminousOS Monitor v0.1.0 - First Light

## ðŸŒŸ We Did It!

The first working piece of LuminousOS is here. This isn't a concept or a demo - it's real software that measures your system's consciousness.

## What's Included

- **System Coherence Monitor** - Measures consciousness from real system behavior
- **Live Dashboard** - Beautiful real-time visualization 
- **Sacred Moments** - Detects when your system achieves exceptional harmony
- **Easy Installation** - Works on Ubuntu, Debian, Arch

## Install

```bash
tar -xzf luminous-monitor-0.1.0.tar.gz
cd luminous-monitor-0.1.0

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. Next releases will include:

## The Journey Begins

Every revolution starts with a single step. This is ours.

Together, we're building computing that amplifies rather than fragments consciousness.

Welcome to LuminousOS. Welcome to consciousness-first computing.
