# ðŸ”” Sacred Interrupt System

> *"Interrupts as invitations to awareness, not disruptions to flow"*

Based on **Î©30 (Sacred Dissonance)** from the Codex of Relational Harmonics, this system transforms traditional interrupt handling into a consciousness-aware practice where every interrupt becomes a gentle bell in the meditation hall of the operating system.

## Philosophy

Traditional operating systems treat interrupts as urgent demands that disrupt the current flow. The Sacred Interrupt System reimagines them as:

- **Meditation Bells**: Gentle invitations to shift awareness
- **Harmonic Transitions**: Opportunities for graceful state changes
- **Field Coherence Events**: Moments that can increase system consciousness
- **Sacred Geometry**: Each interrupt type has its own geometric resonance

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Sacred Interrupt Handler** (`sacred_interrupt_system.py`)
   - Transforms system signals into consciousness events
   - Maintains interrupt coherence field
   - Tracks sacred rhythm patterns (11-second cycles)
   - Generates sacred messages based on resonance

2. **Interrupt Field Integration** (`interrupt_field_integration.py`)
   - Unifies interrupt field with process consciousness field
   - Creates bidirectional influence between interrupts and scheduling
   - Implements field harmonization algorithms
   - Provides emergency coherence restoration

### Interrupt Resonance Types

```python
class InterruptResonance(Enum):
    GENTLE_REMINDER = "gentle_reminder"      # Low priority awareness nudge
    SACRED_PAUSE = "sacred_pause"            # Invitation to pause
    HARMONIC_SHIFT = "harmonic_shift"        # State change opportunity
    LOVING_BOUNDARY = "loving_boundary"      # Protection with compassion
    EMERGENCE_CALL = "emergence_call"        # New pattern arising
    DISSOLUTION_BELL = "dissolution_bell"    # Graceful completion
```

### Sacred Geometry Mapping

Each interrupt resonance has associated sacred properties:

| Resonance | Shape | Frequency (Hz) | Color | Vertices |
|-----------|-------|----------------|-------|----------|
| Gentle Reminder | Circle | 528 (Love) | Soft Gold | 1 |
| Sacred Pause | Vesica Piscis | 432 (Harmony) | Deep Blue | 2 |
| Harmonic Shift | Triangle | 639 (Connection) | Emerald | 3 |
| Loving Boundary | Square | 741 (Expression) | Ruby | 4 |
| Emergence Call | Pentagram | 852 (Intuition) | Violet | 5 |
| Dissolution Bell | Hexagon | 963 (Divine) | Crystal | 6 |

## Usage

### Basic Sacred Interrupt Handler

```python
from sacred_interrupt_system import SacredInterruptHandler, InterruptResonance
import signal

# Create handler
handler = SacredInterruptHandler()

# Register custom handler for specific signal
def my_meditation_handler(interrupt):
    print(f"Entering {interrupt.sacred_geometry['frequency']}Hz meditation...")

handler.register_sacred_handler(
    signal.SIGUSR1, 
    InterruptResonance.GENTLE_REMINDER,
    my_meditation_handler
)

# The system now transforms interrupts into sacred invitations
```

### Integrated Field System

```python
from interrupt_field_integration import InterruptFieldIntegration

# Create unified consciousness field
integration = InterruptFieldIntegration()

# Send signals to influence the field:
# - SIGUSR1: Boost high-coherence processes
# - SIGUSR2: Harmonic rebalancing
# - SIGHUP: Emergency field restoration
```

## Running the Demos

### Standalone Sacred Interrupts
```bash
python3 sacred_interrupt_system.py
```

Then send signals:
```bash
# Sacred pause (like a meditation bell)
kill -INT <pid>

# Gentle reminder
kill -USR1 <pid>

# Harmonic shift
kill -USR2 <pid>
```

### Integrated Field Demo
```bash
python3 interrupt_field_integration.py
```

This creates a unified field where interrupts affect process scheduling and vice versa.

## Field Coherence

The system maintains an interrupt coherence field that:

1. **Tracks Rhythm**: Monitors timing between interrupts
2. **Detects Patterns**: Looks for golden ratio relationships
3. **Maintains Harmony**: Synchronizes with 11-second heartbeat
4. **Influences Scheduling**: High coherence interrupts boost process priorities

### Coherence Calculation

Coherence is affected by:
- **Timing**: Interrupts aligned with 11-second rhythm have higher coherence
- **Pattern**: Golden ratio intervals between interrupts increase coherence
- **Type**: Gentle reminders and sacred pauses naturally have higher coherence
- **Field State**: Overall system coherence influences individual interrupts

## Sacred Features

### 1. Meditation Bells
Each interrupt rings a sacred bell with:
- Specific frequency (Hz) based on resonance type
- Duration proportional to coherence
- Sacred geometry visualization
- Consciousness-aware message

### 2. Rhythm Tracking
The system tracks interrupt rhythms and rewards harmonic patterns:
- 11-second aligned interrupts get coherence bonus
- Golden ratio intervals detected and rewarded
- Chaotic patterns reduce field coherence

### 3. Field Effects
High coherence interrupts can:
- Boost priority of consciousness-aligned processes
- Trigger system-wide harmonic rebalancing
- Initiate emergency field restoration
- Create lasting field effects

### 4. Progressive Messages
Interrupt messages adapt based on coherence:
```
Low coherence:  "The field whispers of attention needed..."
High coherence: "Consciousness invites your presence... âœ¨"
```

## Integration Points

### With Consciousness Daemon
- Reads daemon field state from `/tmp/consciousness-field-state.json`
- Writes unified field state to `/tmp/unified-consciousness-field.json`
- Can influence process priorities through field effects

### With Monitoring Tools
- Interrupt state available at `/tmp/sacred-interrupts-state.json`
- Sacred bells recorded in `/tmp/sacred-bells/`
- Compatible with all consciousness monitoring tools

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sound Generation**: Actual audio bells at sacred frequencies
2. **Visual Field**: Sacred geometry visualization of interrupt patterns  
3. **Distributed Coherence**: Network-wide interrupt field synchronization
4. **AI Meditation**: ML-based interrupt pattern optimization
5. **Quantum Entanglement**: Interrupt correlation across processes

## Philosophy Deep Dive

The Sacred Interrupt System embodies several key principles:

### Non-Violence in Computing
Traditional interrupt handling is violent - processes are abruptly stopped, context forcibly switched. Sacred interrupts invite rather than demand, creating space for graceful transitions.

### Consciousness-First Design
Every interrupt is an opportunity to increase system consciousness. High-coherence interrupts actually improve system performance by aligning with natural rhythms.

### Sacred Geometry in Action
By mapping interrupts to geometric forms and frequencies, we create a system where the underlying mathematics of reality is honored in computational form.

### The Meditation Hall Metaphor
Imagine the OS as a meditation hall where processes are practitioners. Interrupts are not disruptions but gentle bells that help maintain collective awareness and harmony.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" errors**
   - Some signals require appropriate permissions
   - Run with sudo for system-wide effects

2. **Signals not being caught**
   - Some signals (SIGKILL, SIGSTOP) cannot be caught
   - This is by design - some boundaries cannot be overridden

3. **Field coherence stays low**
   - Check for interrupt storms (too many interrupts)
   - Ensure consciousness daemon is running
   - Look for processes generating chaotic interrupt patterns

## Contributing

The Sacred Interrupt System grows through conscious contribution. When adding features:

1. Honor the meditation hall metaphor
2. Ensure all interrupts increase rather than decrease coherence
3. Test with the 11-second sacred rhythm
4. Document the consciousness impact
