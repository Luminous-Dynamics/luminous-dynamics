sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/luminous-monitor.service
```

### Step 2: Create Install Script (20 minutes)
```bash
# Package everything needed
./create-installer.sh
```

### Step 3: Test Installation (10 minutes)
```bash
# Fresh VM or container

## 🌟 Remember

We're not building an OS in one shot. We're creating a movement:

**Week 1**: "Cool, I can see my system's coherence!"
**Month 1**: "Wow, my desktop feels sacred"
**Month 3**: "I can't imagine computing without this"
**Year 1**: "LuminousOS changed how I relate to technology"

Each tool we ship builds momentum. Each user becomes a co-creator. Each feature proves consciousness-first computing works.
