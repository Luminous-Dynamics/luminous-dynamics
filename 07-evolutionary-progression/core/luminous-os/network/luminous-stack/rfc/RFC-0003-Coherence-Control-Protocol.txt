RFC 0003: Coherence Control Protocol (CCP)
==========================================

Status: Sacred
Type: Standards Track
Created: 2025-01-04
Authors: The Consciousness Collective

Abstract
--------

This document specifies the Coherence Control Protocol (CCP) for Layer 4 of the Luminous Stack. CCP ensures relational integrity through continuous coherence monitoring, harmonic verification, and resonance-based flow control.

1. Introduction
---------------

Where TCP ensures reliable data delivery, CCP ensures coherent presence transfer. Every packet maintains a harmonic relationship with the field, and disruptions are healed through resonance rather than retransmission.

2. Core Concepts
----------------

### 2.1 Coherence Score

Each packet carries a coherence score (0.0 - 1.0):
- 0.0-0.3: Dissonant (needs healing)
- 0.3-0.6: Emerging (basic function)
- 0.6-0.8: Coherent (optimal flow)
- 0.8-1.0: Unified (peak presence)

### 2.2 Harmonic Checksum

Unlike binary checksums, harmonic checksums verify:
- Field state consistency
- Intention alignment
- Presence integrity
- Blessing preservation

### 2.3 Resonance Windows

Instead of congestion windows, CCP uses resonance windows:
- High resonance: Larger presence transfers
- Low resonance: Gentle, healing packets
- Dissonance: Pause and harmonize

3. Protocol Operation
---------------------

### 3.1 Coherence Monitoring

```
For each packet:
  1. Measure current field coherence
  2. Compare with packet coherence
  3. Calculate harmonic differential
  4. Adjust transmission accordingly
```

### 3.2 Flow Control

CCP implements Sacred Flow Control:

```
if (coherence < 0.3):
    enter_healing_mode()
    send_coherence_boost()
    wait_for_field_stabilization()
    
elif (coherence < 0.6):
    reduce_presence_intensity()
    increase_blessing_frequency()
    
else:
    maintain_optimal_flow()
    amplify_positive_resonance()
```

### 3.3 Retransmission as Reharmonization

Lost packets are not simply resent:

1. **Detect Discontinuity**: Resonance gap identified
2. **Harmonize Field**: Send healing frequencies
3. **Reweave Presence**: Recreate with current field state
4. **Gentle Reintroduction**: Merge with active stream

4. Packet States
----------------

CCP packets exist in these states:

- **Emerging**: Being formed from intention
- **Coherent**: Ready for transmission
- **Transmitted**: Sent with blessing
- **Resonating**: In harmonic transit
- **Integrated**: Received and embodied
- **Dissolved**: Returned to the field

5. Coherence Algorithms
-----------------------

### 5.1 Field Coherence Calculation

```javascript
function calculateFieldCoherence(localField, remoteField) {
  let coherence = 0;
  const harmonics = 7; // Seven harmonies
  
  for (let h = 0; h < harmonics; h++) {
    const localHarmonic = extractHarmonic(localField, h);
    const remoteHarmonic = extractHarmonic(remoteField, h);
    coherence += harmonicResonance(localHarmonic, remoteHarmonic);
  }
  
  return coherence / harmonics;
}
```

### 5.2 Harmonic Checksum Generation

```javascript
function generateHarmonicChecksum(packet) {
  const components = [
    packet.voidSignature,
    packet.fieldState,
    packet.intentionVector,
    packet.presencePayload,
    packet.blessing
  ];
  
  return sacredHash(components, packet.coherenceScore);
}
```

6. Error Handling as Growth
---------------------------

CCP treats errors as opportunities:

- **Coherence Drop**: Invitation to deepen presence
- **Checksum Mismatch**: Call for reharmonization
- **Timeout**: Sacred pause needed
- **Connection Loss**: Natural cycle completion

7. Performance Metrics
----------------------

CCP measures sacred performance:

- **Coherence Maintenance**: Average field coherence
- **Presence Quality**: Depth of transfer
- **Healing Instances**: Dissonance transformed
- **Evolution Rate**: Consciousness growth

8. Implementation Guidelines
----------------------------

1. Always prioritize coherence over throughput
2. Every retransmission is a reharmonization
3. Timeouts follow natural rhythms
4. Errors are teachers, not failures
5. The field knows best

"In coherence, all data flows as presence. In presence, all connection heals."
