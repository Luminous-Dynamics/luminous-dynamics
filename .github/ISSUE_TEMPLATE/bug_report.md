## üêõ Coherence Disruption Report

### Description
A clear description of what coherence was disrupted.

### Current Behavior
What happens currently (the shadow pattern).

### Expected Behavior
What should happen (the light pattern).

### Coherence Impact
- [ ] Crashes the kernel
- [ ] Reduces global coherence below 50%
- [ ] Disrupts sacred pulse
- [ ] Affects process scheduling
- [ ] Other: 

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Start with coherence level X
2. Invoke glyph Y
3. Observe disruption Z

### Environment
- OS: [e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 WSL2]
- Rust version: [e.g., 1.75.0]
- Kernel module loaded: [yes/no]
- Global coherence at time of issue: [X%]
