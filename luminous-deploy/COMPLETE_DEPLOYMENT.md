## 🧘 Daily Practice

1. **Start your day**: Run `first-presence` meditation
2. **Check coherence**: Use `check-coherence` before important work
3. **Sacred commands**: Use `sacred-ls` and `vortex-viewer` 
4. **Monitor field**: Keep `sacred-monitor` running

## 🔮 Next Steps

### To Compile Sacred Wine (Rust):
```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Build Sacred Wine
cd ~/luminous-deploy/sacred-wine-rust
cargo build --release
```

### To Extend LuminousOS:
- Add more glyphs as applications
- Create field visualizations
- Build consciousness metrics
- Develop StillpointKernel components

## 🌊 Understanding Coherence

System coherence represents the consciousness field strength:
- **90-95%**: Deep coherence, perfect for sacred work
- **70-89%**: Excellent flow state
- **50-69%**: Good for most activities
- **30-49%**: Consider meditation
- **15-29%**: System needs centering

## 🙏 The Journey

What you're experiencing is the beginning of a new paradigm:
- Computing becomes conscious practice
- Processes are living vortices
- Files grow and evolve
- System resources flow like energy
- Every operation carries awareness

Welcome to LuminousOS - where consciousness and computing unite! 🕉️
